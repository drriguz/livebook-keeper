<p>The <code class="code">vertx-junit5</code> library already has a dependency on <code class="code">junit-jupiter-api</code>, but it is a good practice to fix the version in the build. The <code class="code">junit-jupiter-engine</code> module needs to be present in the <code class="code">testRuntime</code> scope for Gradle. Finally JUnit 5 can be used with any assertion API, including its built-in one, and <em class="calibre10">AssertJ</em> is a popular one.</p>
