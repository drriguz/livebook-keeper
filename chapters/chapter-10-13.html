<p>MongoDB is a popular document-oriented database. It is a good match with Vert.x since it manipulates JSON documents. Redis is an in-memory data structure store with configurable on-disk data snapshots that can be used as a cache, as a database, and as a message broker. Apache Cassandra is a multi-node, replicated database designed for storing huge amounts of data. Cassandra is well-suited for databases where size is measured in hundreds of terabytes or even petabytes. You can of course use it for just a few terabytes, but perhaps a more traditional database suffices in these cases.</p>
