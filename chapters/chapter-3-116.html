<p>There are several cluster manager implementations for Vert.x based on <em class="calibre10">Hazelcast</em>, <em class="calibre10">Infinispan</em>, <em class="calibre10">Apache Ignite</em> and <em class="calibre10">Apache Zookeeper</em>. Historically <em class="calibre10">Hazelcast</em> was the cluster manager for Vert.x, then other engines were added. They all support the same Vert.x clustering abstractions for membership, shared data and event-bus message passing. They are all functionally equivalent, so you will have to choose one depending on your needs and constraints. If you have no idea which one to pick, then I would recommend going with <em class="calibre10">Hazelcast</em> which is a good default.</p>
