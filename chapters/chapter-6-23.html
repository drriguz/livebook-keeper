<p>A proxy handler listens to the <code class="code">sensor.data-service</code> destination and dispatches method calls based on the message action header and body. The actual <code class="code">SensorDataService</code> implementation is being used here, and the <code class="code">average</code> method is being called. The proxy handler then replies to the event-bus message with a value passed through the <code class="code">average</code> method callback. In turn the client receives the reply through the service proxy, which in turn passes the reply to the callback from the call on the client side.</p>
