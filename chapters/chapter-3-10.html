<p>Messages have a body, optional headers for storing meta-data, and an optional expiration delay after which they will be discarded if they havenâ€™t been processed yet. Message bodies are commonly encoded using the Vert.x JSON representation. The advantage of using JSON is that it is a serialization format that can be easily transported over the network, and all programming languages understand it. It is also possible to use Java primitive and string types, especially as JVM languages that may be used for writing verticles have direct bindings for them. Last but not least: it is possible to register custom encoder / decoders (codec) to support more specialized forms of message body serialization. For instance you could write a codec for converting Java objects to a binary encoding of your own. This is however rarely useful to do so, and in practice JSON and string data cover most Vert.x applications needs.</p>
