<p>The sensor gateway collects temperature updates from the heat sensor services over Vert.x event-bus communications. First off it fetches configuration from environment variables exactly like in listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-13/v-10/sensor-env" shape="rect" title="Example 13.3. Getting the sensor configuration from environment variables">13.3</a> as it needs a HTTP port number and an event bus destination to listen to. The <code class="code">start</code> methods sets an event bus consumer as in listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-13/v-10/gateway-consumer" shape="rect" title="Example 13.4.
