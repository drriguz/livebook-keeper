<p>The action to perform in a health or readiness check depends on what your service does. As a general rule you should perform an action that has no side effect in the system. For instance if your service needs to report a failed health check when a database connection is down, then a safe action should be to perform a small SQL query. By contrast doing a data insertion SQL query has side effects, and this is probably not how you want to check if the database connection is working.</p>
