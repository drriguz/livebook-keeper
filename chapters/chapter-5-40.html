<p>The method shows how easy the web client API is for performing HTTP requests. However the main difficulty lies in the parallel HTTP requests coordination. We need a loop to issue the requests. Since they are asynchronous, we also need to keep track of the number of received responses, as well as the response values. This is done by having a list of responses, and using a counter of responses. Note that we use an <code class="code">AtomicInteger</code> here not because of concurrency, but rather because we need an object to increment an integer from the callbacks.</p>
