<p>The Gradle build is a very simple one for a Java project. Since we will have several examples to run, we donâ€™t rely on the Gradle <code class="code">application</code> plugin but define our own custom <code class="code">run</code> task where we can pass the name of the class to execute. We also take advantage of it to ensure that logging is properly configured and unified to SLF4J.</p>
