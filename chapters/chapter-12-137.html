<p>Observations in the experimentations above showed that requests piled up while waiting for either the databases to be back to nominal conditions, or TCP errors to arise. A first approach could be to enforce short timeouts in the HTTP client requests so that they fail fast when the user profile or activity services take tool long to respond. The changes are very simple: we add timeouts to the HTTP requests done by the Vert.x web client, as shown in listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-12/v-10/timeout-totalSteps" shape="rect" title="Example 12.11. Implementation of the totalSteps method with timeouts">12.11</a>.</p>
