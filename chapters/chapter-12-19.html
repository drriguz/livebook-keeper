<p>First of all when you run 10k steps application as outlined in chapter 7 all services are running locally, while the third party middleware and services are running in Docker containers. This means that everything is actually running on the same machine, avoiding real network communications. For instance when the user profile service talks to MongoDB then it goes through virtual network interfaces, but it never reaches an actual network interface so there is no fluctuating latency or data loss. We will use other tools later in this chapter to simulate network problems, and get a more precise understanding of how our services behave.</p>
