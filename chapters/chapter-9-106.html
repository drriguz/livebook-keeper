<p>The Kafka records also have a key which is the concatenation of several parameters: <code class="code">deviceId:year-month-day</code>. In this scheme all records of device <code class="code">1a2b</code> produced on October 6th 2019 have the key <code class="code">1a2b:2019-10-06</code>. As we will shortly see, the key will be useful not just to ensure that events for a given device are consumed in order, but also to ensure that we donâ€™t send more than 1 congratulation email per day.</p>
