<p>Now feeding MP3 data to many connected players is not as simple as it seems. The main issue is that of ensuring that all <em class="calibre10">current</em> and <em class="calibre10">future</em> players are listening the same music at <em class="calibre10">roughly</em> the same time. All players have different local buffering strategies to ensure smooth playback even when the network suffers delays, but if the server simply pushes files as fast as it can then for sure not all clients will be synchronized. Worse: when a new player connects it may receive nothing to play at all while the current players have several minutes of music to play in their buffers. Hence to provide a sensible playback experience, we need to control the pace at which files are being read, and for that we are going to use a timer.</p>
