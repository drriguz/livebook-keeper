<p>The case of the heat API is more interesting, as we can define both liveness and readiness checks. Indeed, the API needs the sensor gateway, so its readiness depends on that of the gateway. First, we have to define 2 routes for liveness and readiness checks, as shown in listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-13/v-10/api-health-routes" shape="rect" title="Example 13.33. Health checks routes of the heat API service">13.33</a>.</p>
