<p>This RxJava pipeline is reminiscent of those we have seen earlier about the messaging and eventing stack, as we compose 3 asynchronous operations. This pipeline reads from Kafka, inserts database records (<code class="code">insertRecord</code>), produces a query to write to Kafka (<code class="code">generateActivityUpdate</code>) then commits it (<code class="code">commitKafkaConsumerOffset</code>).</p>
