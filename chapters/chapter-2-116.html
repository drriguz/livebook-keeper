<p>While deploying a verticle, there is an option for enabling multi-threading for worker verticles, in which case multiple events can be processed concurrently by a verticle, breaking the single-threaded processing assumption. This was always considered fairly advanced usage, and many users ended-up using it the wrong way and catching concurrency bugs. The feature is now under-cover and may even disappear in future Vert.x releases. Users are encouraged to simply adjust worker pool sizes to match the workload rather than enabling worker multi-threading.</p>
