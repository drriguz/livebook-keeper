<p>Since the test plan starts with databases running nominally, the service manages to cache data for the test user. This is why we get no error across the whole run. We see a few successes with higher latency when the network delays appear, which actually impact the last few percentiles above 9.999th. These are due to the circuit breaker reporting timeouts on making HTTP requests, but note that the circuit breaker cannot <em class="calibre10">cancel</em> the HTTP requests. Hence we have a few HTTP requests waiting for an unresponsive activity service, while the circuit breaker meanwhile completes the corresponding HTTP responses with some cached data.

Total steps count load test with failures, timeouts and a circuit breaker">12.14</a> shows the effect of combining the circuit breaker with a 5 seconds timeout on the web client HTTP requests (see the <code class="code">chapter12/public-api-with-circuit-breaker-and-timeouts</code> branch of the Git repository).</p>
