<p>Vue.js is a modern JavaScript frontend framework like <em class="calibre10">React</em> or <em class="calibre10">Angular</em> for building modern web applications, including single-page applications. It is <em class="calibre10">reactive</em> as changes in a component model trigger changes in the user interface. Suppose that we display a temperature in a web page, when the corresponding data changes, then the temperature is updated, and Vue.js takes care of (most) of the plumbing for doing that.</p>
