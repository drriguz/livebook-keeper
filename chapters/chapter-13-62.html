<p>Kubernetes has a command-line tool called <code class="code">kubectl</code> that you can use to perform <em class="calibre10">anything</em>: deploying services, collecting logs, configure DNS, and more. <code class="code">kubectl</code> is the Swiss-knife of Kubernetes. We could hence use <code class="code">kubectl</code> to apply the Kubernetes resource definitions found in each service <code class="code">k8s/</code> folder. We will later describe the resources in the <code class="code">k8s/</code> folders: if you are new to Kubernetes all you need to know right now is that these files tell Kubernetes how to deploy the 3 services of this chapter.</p>
