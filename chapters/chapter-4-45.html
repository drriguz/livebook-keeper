<p>As you can guess one solution lies in <em class="calibre10">back-pressure signaling</em>, so that the read stream adapts to the throughput of the write stream. Back to the previous example when the HTTP response write queue grows too big, then it should be able to notify the file read stream that it goes too fast. In practice pausing the source stream is a good way to manage back-pressure, as it gives a chance to write the items in the write buffer while not accumulating new ones.</p>
