<p>The code in listing <a class="pcalibre para2" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-6/v-10/sensordataserviceimpl" shape="rect" title="Example 6.4. Implementation of SensorDataService">6.4</a> is free of asynchronous operations. In more elaborated services you will quickly stumble upon cases where you issue asynchronous calls to some other component like a database, a HTTP service, a message broker or even another service over the event-bus. Once you have a response ready, you will pass the result or an error to the method callback just like we did in <code class="code">SensorDataServiceImpl</code>.</p>
