<p>The plot contains values at the 95th, 98th, 99th and 100th percentiles. The reported latencies are under 200ms at the 99th percentile for all requests, which sound reasonable for a run with imperfect conditions and no tuning. The 100th percentile values show us the worst response times that have been observed, and they are all under 500ms.</p>
