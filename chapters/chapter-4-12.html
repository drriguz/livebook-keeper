<p>Read and write stream are defined through the <code class="code">ReadStream</code> and <code class="code">WriteStream</code> interfaces of the <code class="code">io.vertx.core.streams</code> package. You will mostly deal with APIs that implement these 2 interfaces rather than implement them yourself, although you may have to do so if you want to connect to some third-party asynchronous events API.</p>
