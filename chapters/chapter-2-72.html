<p>To better understand what happens here, figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-2/v-10/async-with-future" shape="rect" title="Figure 2.3. Sequence diagram when starting a HTTP server with a promise and a listen handler">2.3</a> illustrates the interactions between the verticle, the Vert.x object, and the internal Vert.x deployer object responsible for calling the <code class="code">start</code> method. We can check that the deployer waits for the promise completion to know if the deployment was a success or not, even after the call to method <code class="code">start</code> has returned. By contrast figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-2/v-10/async-without-future" shape="rect" title="Figure 2.2. Sequence diagram when starting a HTTP server without a promise and a listen handler">2.2</a> shows the interactions when not using the variant of <code class="code">start</code> that accepts a <code class="code">Promise</code> object, and there is no way the deployer is being notified of an error.</p>
