<p>You can use <code class="code">CompositeFuture</code> to make a future out of several ones. The <code class="code">all</code> static method results in a future that is completed when all futures are completed, and fails when any future has failed. There also exist <code class="code">any</code> and <code class="code">join</code> that have different semantics.</p>
