<p>Vert.x does not prescribe any object-relational mapping tool. Doing plain SQL is actually a great option, but if you want to abstract your code from the particularities of databases and use an API to build your queries rather than using strings then I recommend looking at jOOQ <a class="pcalibre para2" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-10/v-10/JOOQ" shape="rect">[JOOQ]</a>. You can even find a Vert.x / jOOQ integration module in the community!</p>
