<p>We use a class with static methods to give SQL queries as it is more convenient than plain string constants in our code. The query will be used as a <em class="calibre10">prepared statement</em>, where values prefixed by a <code class="code">$</code> symbol will be taken from a <em class="calibre10">tuple</em> of values. Since we use a prepared statement these values are safe from <em class="calibre10">SQL injection attacks</em>.</p>
