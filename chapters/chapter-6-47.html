<p>If you look into the code of <code class="code">SensorDataServiceVertxProxyHandler</code>, you see a <code class="code">switch</code> block in the <code class="code">handle</code> method, where the <code class="code">action</code> header is being used to dispatch to the service implementation methods. Similarly you will see in the <code class="code">average</code> method of <code class="code">SensorDataServiceVertxEBProxy</code> the code that sends a message over the event-bus to invoke that method. The code of both <code class="code">SensorDataServiceVertxProxyHandler</code> and <code class="code">SensorDataServiceVertxEBProxy</code> is really what you would write if you had to implement your own event-bus service system.</p>
