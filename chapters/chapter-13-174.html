<p>As you can see a readiness probe is configured very much like a liveness probe. We have defined <code class="code">initialDelaySeconds</code> to be of 5 seconds: this is because the initial Hazelcast discovery takes a few seconds, so the sensor gateway hasnâ€™t deployed its verticle before this has been completed.</p>
