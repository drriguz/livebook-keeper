<p>Preparation methods such as <code class="code">createHttpServer</code> or <code class="code">setTimer</code> may be called from a non-Vert.x thread. This may happen when directly using a <code class="code">Vertx</code> object without a verticle, or when writing unit tests. This is however not a problem as usage of the <code class="code">Vertx</code> class methods is thread-safe.</p>
