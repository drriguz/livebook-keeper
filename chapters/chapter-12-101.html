<p>Network delays increase latency, but they also simulate an overloaded database or service that starts to become unresponsive. With extreme delay values they can also simulate an unreachable host where establishing TCP connections takes a long time to fail. On the other hand stopping the databases simulates services down while their hosts remain up, which should lead to quick TCP connection errors.</p>
