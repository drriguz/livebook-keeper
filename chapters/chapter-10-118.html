<p>We could have put all the code on a single verticle, but this decoupling renders the code more manageable as each verticle has a well-defined purpose. <code class="code">EventsVerticle</code> performs writes to the database, while <code class="code">ActivityApiVerticle</code> performs the read operations.</p>
