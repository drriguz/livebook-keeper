<p>Jib needs to know the main class to execute as well as the ports to be exposed outside the container. In the case of the heat sensor and sensor gateway services we need to expose port 8080 for the HTTP service, and port 5701 for the Vert.x clustering with Hazelcast. The JVM tuning is limited to disabling the JVM bytecode verifier to boot marginally faster, and also using <code class="code">/dev/urandom</code> for random numbers generation (the default <code class="code">/dev/random</code> pseudo-file may block when a container starts and there isnâ€™t enough entropy). Finally we run as user <code class="code">nobody</code> in group <code class="code">nobody</code> to ensure the process runs as an unprivileged user inside the container.</p>
