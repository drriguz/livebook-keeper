<p>The test case has a proxy reference to make calls to <code class="code">SensorDataService</code>. The actual <code class="code">DataVerticle</code> verticle is being deployed at destination <code class="code">sensor.data-service</code>. It can issue <code class="code">valueFor</code> and <code class="code">average</code> method calls from tests. Since <code class="code">DataVerticle</code> receives messages from sensors on the event-bus, we can send arbitrary messages rather than deploying actual <code class="code">HeatSensor</code> verticles over which we have no control. Mocking a verticle is often as simple as sending the type of messages it would send.</p>
