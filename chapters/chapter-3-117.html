<p>Finally as shown in figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-3/v-10/clustering" shape="rect" title="Figure 3.6. Overview of the Vert.x clustering">3.6</a>, the event-bus communications between nodes happen through direct TCP connections, using a custom protocol. When a node sends a message to a destination, then it checks the subscribers topology with the cluster manager, and dispatches the message to the nodes that have subscribers for that destination.</p>
