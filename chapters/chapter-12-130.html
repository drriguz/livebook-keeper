<p>Network delays also cause the system to come to a halt, but we do not observe the same shape in the scatter plot. This is due to the inherently lower throughput of the service for this type of requests, and also the fact that 2 HTTP requests are needed. Requests pile up, waiting for responses to arrive, and once delays stop the system gets going again. More interestingly we do not observe errors in the phase where databases have been stopped, there are just no requests being served anymore as the system is waiting for databases.</p>
