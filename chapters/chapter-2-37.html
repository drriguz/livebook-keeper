<p>An obvious benefit with this design is that a verticle instance is always executing event processing on the same thread, so there is no need for using thread synchronization primitives. In a multi-threaded design updating the <code class="code">counter</code> field would require either a <code class="code">synchronized</code> block or the usage of <code class="code">java.util.concurrent.AtomicLong</code>. There is no such issue here so a plain <code class="code">long</code> field can be safely used.</p>
