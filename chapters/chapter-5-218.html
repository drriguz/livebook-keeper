<p>Coroutines are no magic, and the implementation requires special compiler and runtime library support. The intuition is that a suspending function is split as many functions. The split points are the suspending function calls, where the <em class="calibre9">rest</em> of the function ends up in another function (called a <em class="calibre9">&quot;continuation&quot;</em>). There is then a finite state machine to know what split function to call when the suspended function shall resume. The whole proposal and design proposal for Kotlin coroutines is at <a class="pcalibre para2" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-5/v-10/KeepKtCoroutines" shape="rect">[KeepKtCoroutines]</a>.</p>
