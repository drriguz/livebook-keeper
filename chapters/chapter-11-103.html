<p>Each record sent to <code class="code">event-stats.user-activity.updates</code> contains the latest number of steps for a given user. The dashboard service can observe these events, update its state to keep track of how many steps a given user has done, and update the global ranking accordingly. The problem here is that we need some state to start with, because when it starts (or re-starts!) the dashboard service doesnâ€™t know about the earlier updates.</p>
