<p>Vert.x offers an event bus integration using the <em class="calibre10">SockJS</em> library <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-11/v-10/SockJS" shape="rect">[SockJS]</a>. SockJS is an emulation library for the WebSocket protocol <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-11/v-10/WebSocket" shape="rect">[WebSocket]</a>, which allows browsers and servers to communicate in both directions on top of a persistent connection. The Vert.x core APIs offer support for WebSockets, but SockJS is interesting because not every browser in the market properly supports WebSockets, and some HTTP proxies / load balancers may reject WebSocket connections. SockJS uses WebSockets whenever it can, and fallbacks to other mechanisms such as long polling over HTTP, AJAX, JSONP or iframe.</p>
