<p>The full code of the usage of the Vert.x event bus in a Vue.js component is in the <code class="code">part2-steps-challenge/dashboard-webapp/src/App.vue</code> file of the source code repository. As we can see we have the same programming model in the JavaScript code: we can register event bus handlers and publish messages, just like we would to in Vert.x code.</p>
