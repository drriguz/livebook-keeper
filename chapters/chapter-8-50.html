<p>JWT is only one protocol supported by Vert.x. Vert.x offers the <code class="code">vertx-auth-oauth2</code> module for OAuth2 which is a popular protocol among public service providers like Google, GitHub or Twitter. You will be interested in using it if your application needs to integrate with such service (e.g., accessing a user GMail account data), or when your application wants to expose to grant access to third-party services with OAuth2.</p>
