<p>Another benefit of Minikube is that it offers environment variables for Docker daemons, so you can have your locally-built container images be available straight inside the cluster. In other Kubernetes configuration you would have to push images to private or public registries, which can slow the development feedback loop especially when pushing a few hundreds of megabytes to public registries over a slow Internet connection. We are assuming that you will use Minikube here, but feel free to use any other option.</p>
