<p>Since operations like <code class="code">deployVerticle</code> and <code class="code">send</code> are asynchronous, the test runner thread exits the method before they have any chance to complete. The <code class="code">VertxExtension</code> class takes care of that, by waiting for <code class="code">VertxTestContext</code> to report either a success or a failure. To avoid tests to wait forever, there is a timeout (30 seconds by default).</p>
