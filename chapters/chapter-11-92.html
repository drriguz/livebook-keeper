<p>The handlers update the model based on what is received from the event-bus. Since Vue.js is a reactive web application framework, the interface is updated when the data model changes. For instance when the value of <code class="code">throughput</code> changes, then so does the value displayed by the HTML template of listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-11/v-10/vue-throughput" shape="rect" title="Example 11.17. Throughput Vue.js HTML template">11.17</a>.</p>
