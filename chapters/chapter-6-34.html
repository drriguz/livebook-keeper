<p>The <code class="code">SensorDataServiceVertxEBProxy</code> class is being generated by the Vert.x code generator, and if you peek into it, you will see event-bus operations. There is also a <code class="code">SensorDataServiceVertxProxyHandler</code> class being generated, but only Vert.x will use it, not your code.</p>
