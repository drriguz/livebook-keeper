<p>The base image comes from the <em class="calibre10">AdoptOpenJDK</em> project that publishes many builds of OpenJDK. Here we are using OpenJDK 11 as a <em class="calibre10">Java Runtime Environment</em> (JRE) rather than a full <em class="calibre10">Java Development Kit</em> (JDK). This saves disk space as we just need a runtime, and a JDK image is bigger than a JRE one. The <code class="code">ubi-minimal</code> part is because we use an <em class="calibre10">AdoptOpenJDK</em> build variant based on the <em class="calibre10">Red Hat Universal Base Image</em>, where the &quot;minimal&quot; variant limits the embedded dependencies to a minimum.</p>
