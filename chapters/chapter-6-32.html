<p>The <code class="code">@ProxyGen</code> annotation is used to mark an event-bus service interface so as to generate the proxy code. The methods in a service interface need to adhere to a few conventions, notably that of having a callback as the last parameter. You will be tempted to use return values rather than callbacks, but remember that we are dealing with asynchronous operations, so we need callbacks!</p>
