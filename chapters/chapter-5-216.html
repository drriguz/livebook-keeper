<p>You may have noticed the <code class="code">launch</code> function call to wrap the whole method code. This is because while the <code class="code">start</code> method is suspending, the HTTP request handler is not a suspending function type, and it is going to be called outside of a Kotlin coroutine context. Calling <code class="code">launch</code> ensures a coroutine context is being created, so suspending methods can be called. Also, the coroutine is automatically attached to a context that ensures events run on the verticle event-loop thread (thanks to the internals of <code class="code">CoroutineVerticle</code>).</p>
