<p>Once the application services have been built, you will need to run all infrastructure services like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Apache Kafka, etc. You can greatly simplify the task by running them from Docker containers. To do that, the <code class="code">docker-compose.yml</code> file describes several containers to be run with <em class="calibre10">Docker Compose</em>, a simple and effective tool to manage several containers at once. Running <code class="code">docker-compose up</code> will start all containers, while <code class="code">docker-compose down</code> will stop and remove them all. You can also hit <code class="code">Ctrl+C</code> in a terminal running Docker Compose and it will stop the containers (but not remove them so they can be started with the current state again).</p>
