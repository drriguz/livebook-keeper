<p>Now if you use PostgreSQL or MySQL then Vert.x provides its own reactive drivers. These drivers implement the network protocols of each database servers, and they are built in a purely asynchronous fashion using Netty, the networking foundation of Vert.x. The drivers offer excellent performance, both in terms of latency and concurrent connections. They are also very stable and implement the current protocols and features of the databases. You should prefer the Vert.x reactive driver clients for PostgreSQL and MySQL, and use the JDBC client when you need to connect to other databases.</p>
