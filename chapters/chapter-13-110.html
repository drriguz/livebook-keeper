<p>Both Hazelcast and Infinispan that you used in an earlier chapter by default use multicast communications to discover nodes. This is great for local testing and many &quot;bare metal&quot; server deployments, but multicast communications are not possible in a Kubernetes cluster. So if you run the containers as-is on Kubernetes, the heat sensor services and sensor gateway instances will not be able to communicate over the event-bus.</p>
