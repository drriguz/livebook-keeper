<p>In this example <code class="code">job1</code> is created using <code class="code">launch</code>, which executes some code in parallel. It waits for 500ms. The same applies to <code class="code">job2</code>, except that <code class="code">async</code> is for code blocks that return a value. It computes the <em class="calibre10">Fibonacci</em> value of 42, which takes some time. The <code class="code">join</code> and <code class="code">await</code> method on the jobs allow to wait for these jobs to complete. Last but not least the <code class="code">main</code> function is wrapped in a <code class="code">runBlocking</code> call. This is because suspending methods are being called, so the execution must wait for all coroutines to complete.</p>
