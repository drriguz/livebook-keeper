<p>Kubernetes performs <em class="calibre10">rolling updates</em> when a deployment is updated by progressively replacing pods of the older configuration with pods with the newer configuration. It is best to adapt the values of <code class="code">maxSurge</code> and <code class="code">maxUnavailable</code> to 1. By doing so Kubernetes replaces pods one after the other, so the cluster state is smoothly transferred to the new pods. You can avoid this configuration and let Kubernetes be more aggressive when rolling updates, but the cluster state may be inconsistent for some time.</p>
