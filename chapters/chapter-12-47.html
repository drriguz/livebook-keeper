<p>Looking at latency distributions is more telling of a service behavior under load than looking at the average latency. What we are actually interested is not the best cases but those were we observed the worst results. Figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-12/v-10/plot-locust-run-c150-h2-t5" shape="rect" title="Figure 12.2. Latencies observed with Locust with 150 users over 5 minutes">12.2</a> shows us latency report over a run that I did with 150 users over 5 minutes.</p>
