<p>With <code class="code">let a = [1, 2, 3]</code>, <code class="code">a</code> is an array with values 1, 2 and 3. Now suppose that for each value, we want to get the value multiplied by 10 and 100. With <code class="code">map</code>, we could write <code class="code">let b = a.map(x â‡’ [x * 10, x * 100])</code>, which gives us an array of arrays: <code class="code">[ [ 10, 100 ], [ 20, 200 ], [ 30, 300 ] ]</code>.</p>
