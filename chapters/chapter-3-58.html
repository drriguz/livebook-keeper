<p>Listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-3/v-10/HeatSensor" shape="rect" title="Example 3.1. Heat sensor verticle implementation">3.1</a> provides the implementation of the <code class="code">HeatSensor</code> verticle class. It does not use any realistic temperature model but instead uses random increments or decrements. Hence if you run it long enough it may report absurd values, but this is not very important in our journey through reactive applications.</p>
