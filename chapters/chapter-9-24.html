<p>Last but not least, Vert.x provides an event-bus bridge over a simple TCP protocol, with binding in JavaScript, Go, C#, C and Python. This allows to use the event-bus to connect with non-Java applications. We do not cover this piece in the book, but you can easily find out how to use it from the official Vert.x documentation. From the Vert.x side this is really just the event-bus, except that some of the events can be produced and consumed outside of the JVM.</p>
