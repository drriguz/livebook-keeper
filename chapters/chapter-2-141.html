<p>The case of worker verticles is not much different, except that handlers are being executed using one worker thread in a worker thread pool, as illustrated in figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-2/v-10/mm-worker" shape="rect" title="Figure 2.6. A worker verticle and its environment">2.6</a>. They are still verticles just like their event-loop counterparts and the code can assume single-threaded access. There is just no stability in which worker thread is going to be used for processing a worker verticle events.</p>
