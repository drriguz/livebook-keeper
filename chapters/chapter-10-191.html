<p>The technique to test the Kafka event processing part of the <code class="code">EventsVerticle</code> is very similar to what we did in the previous chapter: we are going to send some Kafka records and then observe what Kafka records the service produces. By sending multiple step updates for a given device, we should observe that the service produces updates that accumulate the steps on the current day. Since the service both consumes and produces Kakfa records that reflect the current state of the database we wonâ€™t need to perform SQL queries, observing that correct Kafka record are being produced is sufficient.

Testing the activity service event handling">10.5</a> provides an overview of how the test is being made.</p>
