<p>The HTTP methods are those supported in our API. You can see that we donâ€™t support DELETE for instance. The CORS handler has been installed for all routes, since they are all part of the API and should be accessible from any kind of application, including web browsers. The allowed headers should match what your API needs, and also what clients may pass like specifying a content type, or headers that could be injected by proxies and for distributed tracing purposes.</p>
