<p>The integration tests rely again on <em class="calibre10">TestContainers</em> as we need to have a MongoDB instance running. Once we have the container running, we need to prepare the MongoDB database to be in a <em class="calibre10">clean state</em> before we run any test. This is important to ensure that a test cannot be affected by data left over by a previous test execution. The <code class="code">setup</code> method of class <code class="code">IntegrationTest</code> performs the test preparation as found in listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-10/v-10/up-setup" shape="rect" title="Example 10.27.
