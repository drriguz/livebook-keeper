<p>The other interesting part of the example is the observable that emits events every second. It behaves essentially as a Vert.x timer would be. There are several operator methods in the RxJava APIs that accept a <em class="calibre10">scheduler</em> object, because they need to defer asynchronous tasks. By default they call back from an internal worker thread pool that they manage, which breaks the Vert.x threading model assumptions. We can always pass a Vert.x scheduler to ensure that events are still being called back on the original context event loop.</p>
