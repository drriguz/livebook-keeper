<p>All good things come to an end: this chapter concludes our journey towards reactive applications with Vert.x. We started this book with the fundamentals of asynchronous programming and Vert.x. Asynchronous programming is key to building scalable services, but it comes with challenges and we saw how Vert.x helped in making this programming style simple and enjoyable. In the second part of this book we used a realistic application scenario to study the key Vert.x modules for databases, web, security, messaging and event streaming. This allowed us to build an end-to-end reactive application made of several micro-services. By the end of the book we saw a methodology based on a combination of load and chaos testing to ensure service resilience and responsiveness. This is important as reactive is not just about scalability, it is also about writing services that can cope with failures. We concluded the book with notes on deploying Vert.x services in a Kubernetes cluster, something Vert.x is a natural fit for.</p>
