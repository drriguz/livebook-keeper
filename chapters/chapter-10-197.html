<p>Since we send 2 updates, we skip the emitted record and only perform assertions on the second one, as it should reflect the steps sum of the 2 updates. This code alone is waiting for events to be produced, so we now need to deploy the <code class="code">EventsVerticle</code> and send the 2 updates as in listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-10/v-10/event-test2" shape="rect" title="Example 10.35. Second part of the events verticle test case">10.35</a>.</p>
