<p>We assume basic understanding of containers, Docker and Kubernetes, which is covered in depth in other books such as <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-13/v-10/KubernetesInAction" shape="rect">[KubernetesInAction]</a> and <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-13/v-10/DockerInAction" shape="rect">[DockerInAction]</a>. You should still be able to understand and run the examples in this chapter, learning some Kubernetes basics along the way, but we will not spend time explaining the core concepts of Kubernetes such as <em class="calibre10">pods</em> and <em class="calibre10">services</em>, or describe the subtleties of the <code class="code">kubectl</code> command-line tool.</p>
