<p>We are going to the use the efficient in-memory <em class="calibre10">Caffeine</em> caching library <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-12/v-10/Caffeine" shape="rect">[Caffeine]</a>. This library provides configurable strategies for managing cached data, including count, access and time-based eviction policies. We could cache data in a Java <code class="code">HashMap</code>, but that would quickly expose us to memory exhaustion problems if we didnâ€™t put a proper eviction policy in place. Listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-12/v-10/create-cache" shape="rect" title="Example 12.16. Creating a cache">12.16</a> shows us how to create a cache of at most 10 000 entries where keys are strings and values are long integers.</p>
