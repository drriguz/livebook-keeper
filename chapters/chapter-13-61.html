<p>There is another dashboard that I find particularly efficient and can only recommend that you try: <em class="calibre10">k9s</em> <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-13/v-10/K9S" shape="rect">[K9S]</a>. It works as a command-line tool and it is very fast to move between Kubernetes resources, access pod logs, update replica counts, etc.</p>
