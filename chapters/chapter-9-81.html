<p>In listing <a class="pcalibre para2" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-9/v-10/handleAmqpMessage" shape="rect" title="Example 9.5. Handling AMQP messages">9.5</a> and all subsequent services we will directly work with <code class="code">JsonObject</code> data representation. There is little point in converting the JSON representation to Java domain classes (e.g., a <code class="code">IngestionData</code> class) given that we mostly copy and transform data. You can of course perform such mapping if you have to do some more complex business logic and the cost of abstraction is justified.</p>
