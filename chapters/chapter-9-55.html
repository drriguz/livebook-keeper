<p>Everything begins with the ingestion service, as it receives steps count updates from the pedometers. In our (fictitious!) application, we can expect that several types of pedometers will be available, and that they have different communication capabilities. For example some devices may directly talk to the ingestion service over the Internet, while others may need to reach a gateway that forwards updates to the ingestion service.</p>
