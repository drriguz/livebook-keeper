<p>In a Kafka cluster, events are <em class="calibre10">published</em> and <em class="calibre10">consumed</em> from <em class="calibre10">topics</em> that group related events. Topics are split into <em class="calibre10">replicated partitions</em> which are ordered sequences of events. Each event is identified by its <em class="calibre10">offset</em> position in the event log that materializes its partition.</p>
