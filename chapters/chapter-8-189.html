<p>The REST Assured fluent API allows us to express our request, and then do an assertion on the response. It is possible to extract a response a text or JSON to perform further assertions, as in listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-8/v-10/test-2" shape="rect" title="Example 8.31. Test code for retrieving JWT tokens">8.31</a> which is extracted from the test method that retrieves JWT tokens.</p>
