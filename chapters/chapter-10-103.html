<p>It is important to specify which fields should be part of the response, and be explicit about it. In our case we donâ€™t want to reveal the document identifier so we set it to 0 in the fields document. We also explicitly list the fields that we want to be returned with 1 values. This also ensures that other fields like the password and salt values from the authentication do not get accidentally revealed.</p>
