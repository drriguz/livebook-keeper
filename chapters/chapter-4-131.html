<p>Since we are basically streaming data as fast as we can, <em class="calibre10">Player A</em> finds its internal buffers filled with pretty much all the current file data. While it may be playing at position 0 minute 15 seconds, it has already received data up above the 3 minutes mark. In turn when <em class="calibre10">Player B</em> joins it starts receiving MP3 data chunks much farther from the file, hence it starts playing at position 3 minutes and 30 seconds. If we extend our reasoning to multiple files, then a new player can join and receive no data at all, while the previously connected players may have multiple songs to play in their internal buffers.</p>
