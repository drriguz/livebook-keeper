<p>The results show a clear lack of responsiveness when Pumba runs. In the phase of network delays, we see a rapid latency increase spike to nearly 20 seconds, after which the throughput implodes. What happens here is that requests get enqueued waiting for a response in both the public api and user profile services, up to the point where the system is at a halt. The database delays are between 2.5s and 3.5s, which can temporarily happen in practice. Of course the issue is vastly amplified here due to load testing, but any service with some sustained traffic can show this kind of behavior even with smaller delays.</p>
