<p>The event-bus allows for decoupling between verticles: there is no need for one verticle to access another verticle class, as all that is needed is to agree on destination names and data representation. Another benefit is that since Vert.x is polyglot, the event-bus allows verticles written in different languages to communicate with each other without requiring any complex language interoperability layer, be it to for communications inside the same JVM process or across the network.</p>
