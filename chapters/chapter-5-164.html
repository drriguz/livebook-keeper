<p>By using <code class="code">fetchTemperature</code> to fetch individual responses, we obtain <code class="code">Single</code> objects that observe individual HTTP responses. To compose the results, we use the <em class="calibre10">zip</em> operator that takes severable sources, and composes a result as another <code class="code">Single</code> object. When all HTTP responses are available, the zip operator passes the values to a function that must produce a value (of any type). The returned value is then the <code class="code">Single</code> object that the zip operator emits. Here we build a JSON array using the HTTP response bodies that the Vert.x web client has converted to JSON for us, then we wrap the array in a JSON object.</p>
