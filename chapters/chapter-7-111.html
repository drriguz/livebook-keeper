<p>As such, this service is more a <em class="calibre10">Vue.JS</em> application than a Vert.x application, although it is still interesting to see how Vert.x handles static content serving with minimal efforts. We could have chosen other popular JavaScript frameworks or even no framework at all. I find <em class="calibre10">Vue.JS</em> to be a simple and efficient choice. Also since <em class="calibre10">Vue.JS</em> embraces <em class="calibre10">reactive idioms</em>, it makes for a fully reactive application from the backend API to the frontend.</p>
