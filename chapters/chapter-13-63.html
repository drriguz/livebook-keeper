<p>There is a better tool to improve your local Kubernetes development experience called Skaffold <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-13/v-10/Skaffold" shape="rect">[Skaffold]</a>. Instead of using Gradle (or Maven) to build the services, package them then use <code class="code">kubectl</code> to deploy to Kubernetes, Skaffold is able to do it for us, avoiding unnecessary builds using some caching, performing deployments, aggregating all logs, and cleaning everything on exit. Skaffold also works out of the box with Minikube, so no additional configuration is needed. All it needs is a <code class="code">skaffold.yaml</code> resource descriptor as found in listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-13/v-10/skaffold-yaml" shape="rect" title="Example 13.12. Skaffold configuration">13.12</a> and at the root of the <code class="code">chapter13</code> folder in the Git repository.</p>
