<p>In the phase of databases being down we see errors for the whole simulated outage duration. While it is hard to be surprised about errors, we can see that the system has not come to a halt either. This is far from perfect though, since the reduced throughput is the sign that requests need <em class="calibre10">some</em> time to be given an error, while other requests are waiting until they time out, or eventually complete when the databases restart.</p>
