<p>Worker verticles are a special form of verticles that do not execute on an event-loop. Instead, they execute on <em class="calibre10">worker threads</em>, that is, threads taken from special worker pools. You may define your own worker thread pools and deploy worker verticles to them, but in most cases you will be just fine with using the default Vert.x worker pool.</p>
