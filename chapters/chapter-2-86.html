A verticle that deploys and un-deploys other verticles.">2.9</a> defines a verticle that deploys 50 instances of the <code class="code">EmptyVerticle</code> class from <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-2/v-10/deploy-verticle" shape="rect" title="Example 2.8. A sample verticle to deploy">2.8</a>. The usage of a timer allows separating each deployment by 1 second. The <code class="code">deploy</code> method uses another timer for un-deploying a verticle 5 seconds after it has been deployed. Deployment assigns a unique identifier string to a verticle, which can later be reused for un-deploying.</p>
