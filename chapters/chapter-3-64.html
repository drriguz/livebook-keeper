<p>We did not take advantage of message headers in this example, but it is possible to use them for any meta-data that does not belong to the message body. A common header is that of an &quot;action&quot;, to help receivers know what the message is about. For instance given a <code class="code">database.operations</code> destination, we could use a <code class="code">action</code> header to specify whether we intend to query the database, update an entry, store a new entry, or delete a previously stored one.</p>
