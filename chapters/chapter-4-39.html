<p>Figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-4/v-10/read-then-write" shape="rect" title="Figure 4.1. Reading then writing data between streams without any back-pressure signaling">4.1</a> provides an illustration of how this would work with Vert.x, although this directly generalizes to any non-blocking I/O API. Data buffers are read from the file stream, then passed to a handler. The handler is not likely to do anything else but directly writing each buffer back to the HTTP response stream. Each buffer is eventually written to the underlying TCP buffer, either directly or as smaller chunks. Since the TCP buffer may be full (either because of the network or because the client is busy) it is necessary to maintain a buffer of pending buffers to be written (the write queue in figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-4/v-10/read-then-write" shape="rect" title="Figure 4.1.
