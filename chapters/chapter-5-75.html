<p>The <code class="code">recover</code> operation is called when the promise is failed, and it is used to replace the error by another value. You can see <code class="code">recover</code> as the equivalent of a <code class="code">catch</code> block in Java where you can handle an error. Here we simply provide a recovery value using a succeeded future, but you can also report a <em class="calibre10">failed</em> future in more advanced cases when there is nothing you can do to recover. The <code class="code">map</code> operation transforms a value using a function, while <code class="code">flatMap</code> composes with another asynchronous operation.</p>
