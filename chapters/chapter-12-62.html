<p>This is interesting because to get the number of steps of a user the public API service needs to make a HTTP request to the activity service, which in turn queries a PostgreSQL database. To fetch a JWT token there is more work to do, as the user profile service need to be queried twice, before doing some cryptography work and finally returning a JWT token. The overall latency for these requests is thus impacted by the work done in the HTTP API, in the user and activity services, and finally in the databases.</p>
