<p>There is a tiny vulnerability window for this test to fail in case the first update is sent before midnight and the second right after midnight, in which case the second event will not be a sum of the steps in the 2 events. This is very unlikely to happen since the 2 events will be emitted a few milliseconds appart, but still, it <em class="calibre9">could</em> happen!</p>
