<p>The term coroutines first appeared in a paper from Melvin Conway in 1963 about the design of a COBOL compiler <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-5/v-10/Conway63" shape="rect">[Conway63]</a>. Many languages have support for coroutines, or some form of coroutines: Python (generators), C# (<code class="code">async</code> / <code class="code">await</code> operators), Go (<em class="calibre10">goroutines</em>) and more. Implementations for Java using bytecode instrumentation exist, and a future version of Java will have support for coroutines thanks to Project Loom <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-5/v-10/Loom" shape="rect">[Loom]</a>.</p>
