<p>Let us get back to the heat sensor verticles that we had used in a previous chapter. Suppose that we have several heat sensors, and that we want to expose an API to fetch and aggregate all of the sensors heat data. This is a very simple yet effective example of edge service, as it abstracts the need for a requester to know and contact all sensors. To make things even more interesting, we will also have a <em class="calibre10">snapshot</em> service that captures and logs the sensor values before they are returned to the requester. The whole scenario is illustrated in figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-5/v-10/edge-service" shape="rect" title="Figure 5.1. Edge service scenario">5.1</a>.</p>
