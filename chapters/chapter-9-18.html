<p>AMQP is a standard protocol for messaging middleware and is implemented by a large number of brokers such as Apache ActiveMQ, JBoss A-MQ, Windows Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ and more. Vert.x provides a dedicated client for RabbitMQ and its extensions. Note that it is also possible to use the Vert.x AMQP client with RabbitMQ since it exposes an AMQP server alongside the RabbitMQ-specific server.</p>
