<p>Remember that we are on an event-loop, so parser handlers are processing <em class="calibre9">parser records</em> one at a time. When we switch from, say, a delimiter mode to a fixed size mode, then the next record is emitted by processing the remaining stream data based on a number of bytes rather than looking for some string. The same reasoning applies when switching from a fixed sized mode to a delimiter mode.</p>
