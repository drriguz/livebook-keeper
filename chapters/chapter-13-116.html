<p>We disable the default discovery mechanism and enable the Kubernetes ones. Here Hazelcast forms clusters of pods that belong to a service where a label <code class="code">vertx-in-action</code> is defined with value <code class="code">chapter13</code>. Since we opened port 5701 the pods will be able to connect. Note that the configuration is the same for the sensor gateway.</p>
