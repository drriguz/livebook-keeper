<p>As you dig through the specifications then implementation of the services, you may find the decomposition a bit artificial at times. For instance the user profile and activity services could well be just one, saving some requests to join data from the 2 services. Remember that the decomposition was also made for pedagogical reasons, and to show relevant elements from the Vert.x stack. Making an application from (micro) services requires some compromises, especially as some services may be pre-existing and you have to deal with them as they are, or you have limited abilities to evolve them.</p>
