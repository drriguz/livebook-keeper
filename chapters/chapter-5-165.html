<p>Note that <code class="code">zip</code> has many overloaded definitions with varying number of parameters to cope with 2 sources, 3 sources, etc. When the code needs to handle an undefined number of sources, there is a variant taking a list of sources, and the function passed to <code class="code">zip</code> accepts a list of values.</p>
