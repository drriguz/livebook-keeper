<p>Strictly speaking, <em class="calibre10">chaos engineering</em> is the practice of voluntarily introducing failures in production systems to see how they react to unexpected application, network and infrastructure failures. For instance you can try to shut down a database, take down a service, introduce network delays or even interrupt traffic between networks. Instead of waiting for failures to happen in production and wake up on-duty site reliability engineers at 4am on a Sunday, you decide to be pro-active by periodically introducing failures yourself.</p>
