<p>Errors happen: for instance we can loose the connection to the AMQP broker. In this case an error passes along the pipeline, and <code class="code">logAmqpError</code> logs it, but <code class="code">doOnError</code> lets the error propagate to subscribers. We then need to retry connecting to the AMQP broker and resume receiving events, which translates to re-subscribing to the source in RxJava. We can do that we the <code class="code">retryWhen</code> operator as it allows us to define our own policy. If you just want to retry a number of times, or even always, then <code class="code">retry</code> is simpler.

Recovering from errors with a delayed re-subscription">9.4</a> shows how we introduce a 10 seconds delay before re-subscribing.</p>
