<p>The impact of the circuit breaker is striking: the service is now <em class="calibre10">highly</em> responsive during failure periods! We get a high throughput during failures as the service now fails fast when the circuit breaker is open. Interestingly we can spot when the circuit breaker tries making requests when in <em class="calibre10">half-open</em> state: these are the high-latency error points at regular intervals. We can also see that the 99.99th percentile is back to a lower latency compared to the previous runs.</p>
