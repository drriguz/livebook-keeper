<p>So Vert.x gives us a foundation for asynchronous programming on top of the JVM to meet demanding workloads, but how about dealing with failure? This is the other core challenge that we have to meet, and the answer is not that of a magic tool to pick off-the-shelf. Suppose that we have a service that talks to some database that becomes irresponsive because of some internal problem like a deadlock. Then some delay will elapse until our service gets notified of an error, for instance in the form of a TCP connection timeout. In such a case the latency explodes. By contrast if the database is down, then we get an immediate TCP connection error: latency is very good, but since the service cannot talk to its database then it is unable to process a request!</p>
