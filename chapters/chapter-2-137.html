<p>The Vert.x instance exposes the core APIs for declaring event handlers. We have been using it already in the previous code samples with methods such as <code class="code">setTimer</code>, <code class="code">setPeriodic</code>, <code class="code">createHttpServer</code>, <code class="code">deployVerticle</code>, etc. The Vert.x instance is being shared by multiple verticles, and there is generally only 1 instance of <code class="code">Vertx</code> per JVM process.</p>
