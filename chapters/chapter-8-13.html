<p>This service is a edge service (or service gateway depending on how you prefer to name it) as it exposes an HTTP API, but it essentially composes functionality found in other services. In this case the user profile and activity services are being used. These 2 services are internal to the application and not publicly exposed. They also lack any form of authentication and access-control, which is something the public API cannot afford for most operations.</p>
