<p>Kotlin coroutines have the advantage of writing code that doesnâ€™t look like asynchronous code. Simple error management cases can be expressed with familiar <code class="code">try / catch</code> blocks. Although not mentioned here, Kotlin coroutines support channels and selectors in the style of the Go programming language, which allows message passing between coroutines. That being said, more sophisticated error management such as retries need to be expressed manually. Last but not least: it remains important to be aware of how coroutines and asynchronous programming work.</p>
