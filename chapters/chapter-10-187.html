<p>Here we want a database with a data set that we control with activities for devices <code class="code">123</code>, <code class="code">456</code>, <code class="code">abc</code> and <code class="code">def</code> at various points in time. For instance device <code class="code">123</code> recorded 320 steps on 2019/05/21 at 11:00, and that was the 4th time the device made a successful synchronization with the backend. We can then perform checks against the HTTP API like in listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-10/v-10/check123" shape="rect" title="Example 10.32. Checking steps for device 123 on a given month">10.32</a> where we check the number of steps for device <code class="code">123</code> in May 2019.</p>
