<p>Prometheus metrics are exposed in a simple text format. As you can see when running the commands above that by default lots of interesting metrics are being reported like response times, open connections and more. You can also define your own metrics using the Vert.x Micrometer module APIs and have them being exposed just like the default ones.</p>
