<p>Listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-2/v-10/blocker-logs" shape="rect" title="Example 2.6. Sample log output when running listing 2.5">2.6</a> provides a typical log output when running the code from listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-2/v-10/blocker" shape="rect" title="Example 2.5. Sample where the event-loop is being blocked">2.5</a>. As we can see, warnings start to appear as the event-loop thread is still running the infinite loop, and hence is not available for processing other events. After some iterations (5 seconds by default) the warning is being enriched with stack trace dumps, so we can clearly identify the culprit in our code. Note that this is only a warning, the event-loop thread checker cannot kill the handler that is taking too long to complete its task.</p>
