<p>Let us take the example of a key / value database storage, where each key and value is a string. In such a database we could have entries such as <code class="code">1 → {foo}</code> and <code class="code">2 → {bar, baz}</code> with <code class="code">1</code> and <code class="code">2</code> being keys.</p>
