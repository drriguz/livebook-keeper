<p>Since <code class="code">data</code> emits a JSON object, the <code class="code">flatMap</code> operator allows to issue a HTTP request with the web client once that JSON object has been emitted. We need another (nested) <code class="code">flatMap</code> after the HTTP request to the snapshot service has succeeded. Indeed, <code class="code">rxSendJsonObject</code> gives a single observable that emits a HTTP response. However, we need the JSON object because it has to be returned to the requester after sending to the snapshot service has succeeded, so the second <code class="code">flatMap</code> allows to do that and re-inject it in the pipeline. This is a very common pattern with RxJava.</p>
