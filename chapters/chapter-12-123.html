<p>To run these experiments you will use the same shell scripts to launch Hey as we did earlier in this chapter. You will preferably use 2 machines. The <code class="code">part2-steps-challenge/load-testing</code> folder contains a <code class="code">run-chaos.sh</code> shell script to automate the test plan by calling Pumba at the right time. The key is to start both the <code class="code">run-chaos.sh</code> and Hey scripts (e.g., <code class="code">run-hey-token.sh</code>) at the same time.</p>
