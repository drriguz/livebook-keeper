<p>You could thus choose a base image with Java, then copy a self-contained executable Jar file to be run. While this approach is simple and works just fine, it means that for every change in the source code you need to build a new image layer of the size of the Jar file, which includes all dependencies such as Vert.x, Netty, and more. The compiled classes of a service typically weight a few kilobytes, while a self-contained Jar file weights a few megabytes.</p>
