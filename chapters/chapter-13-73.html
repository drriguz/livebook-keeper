<p>This works because Minikube also exposes <code class="code">LoadBalancer</code> services as <code class="code">NodePort</code> on the Minikube instance IP. Both methods are equivalent when using Minikube, but the one using <code class="code">minikube tunnel</code> is closer to what you would get with a production cluster since the service is accessed via a cluster-external IP address.</p>
