<p>Listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-2/v-10/standalone-context" shape="rect" title="Example 2.18. Creating contexts without a verticle">2.18</a> gives an example where a global <code class="code">Vertx</code> instance is being created, and 2 calls to <code class="code">getOrCreateContext</code> are being made on the JVM process main thread. Each call is followed by a call to <code class="code">runOnContext</code>, which allows running a block of code on the context thread.</p>
