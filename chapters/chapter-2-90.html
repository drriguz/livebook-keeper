<p>Running this example yield log entries as found in listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-2/v-10/deploy-logs" shape="rect" title="Example 2.11. Logs excerpts of running the code in listing 2.10">2.11</a>. We can see the log entries from the <code class="code">vert.x-eventloop-thread-0</code> thread: they correspond to the <code class="code">Deployer</code> verticle. We can then see life-cycle log events from <code class="code">EmptyVerticle</code> instances, and they use other event-loop threads.</p>
