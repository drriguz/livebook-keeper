<p>Let us now see another form of data aggregation based on RxJava operators by computing per-city trends. More specifically we are interested in computing periodically how many steps have been recorded in each city on the current day. To do that we can re-use the events published to the <code class="code">event-stats.user-activity.updates</code> Kafka topic by the very same event stats service, since they contain how many steps a user has recorded today along with other data, including the city.</p>
