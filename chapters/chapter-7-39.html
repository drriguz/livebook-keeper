<p>All services are powered by Vert.x, and we also need some third-party middleware, labelled as <em class="calibre10">&quot;infrastructure services&quot;</em> in figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-7/v-10/big-picture" shape="rect" title="Figure 7.5. Overview of the application architecture">7.5</a>. We use 2 different types of databases: a document-oriented database (<em class="calibre10">MongoDB</em>) and a relational database (<em class="calibre10">PostgreSQL</em>). We need a SMTP server to send emails. <em class="calibre10">Apache Kafka</em> is being used for for event stream processing between some services. Since the ingestion service may receive updates from HTTP and AMQP, we also use an <em class="calibre10">ActiveMQ Artemis</em> server.</p>
