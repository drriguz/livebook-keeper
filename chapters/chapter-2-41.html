<p>Note that we represented the calls to <code class="code">requestHandler</code> and <code class="code">listen</code> as being to the <code class="code">Vertx</code> object as a shortcut, while in reality they are on an object that implements the <code class="code">HttpServer</code> interface. The actual class is internal to Vert.x, and since it doesnâ€™t serve the diagram to add another participant we merged it into <code class="code">Vertx</code>.</p>
