<p>Authenticating a user against a username and password is very simple. All we need to do is querying the authentication provider, which returns a <code class="code">io.vertx.ext.auth.User</code> instance on success. In our case we are not interested in querying permissions or roles, so all we want to do is check that authentication succeeded.</p>
