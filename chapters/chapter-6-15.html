<p>You may already be familiar with <em class="calibre10">remote procedure calls</em>, a popular abstraction in distributed computing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-6/v-10/RPC" shape="rect">[RPC]</a>. RPCs where introduced to hide network communications when <em class="calibre10">calling</em> functions running on another machine (the server). The idea is that a local function acts as a proxy, sends a message with the call arguments over the network to the server, and the server then calls the <em class="calibre10">real</em> function. The response is then sent back to the proxy, and the client has the illusion of having called a regular, local function.</p>
