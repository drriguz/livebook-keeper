<p>We also have the definition of the route for GET requests to <code class="code">monthlySteps</code> where the request first goes through <code class="code">jwtHandler</code> then <code class="code">checkUser</code>, as illustrated in figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-8/v-10/routing-chain" shape="rect" title="Figure 8.3. Routing chain for the monthly steps endpoint">8.3</a>. This is useful for decomposing a HTTP request processing concerns in several steps: <code class="code">jwtHandler</code> checks that a valid JWT token is in the request, <code class="code">checkUser</code> checks that the JWT token grants permissions to access the resource, and finally <code class="code">monthlySteps</code> gives how many steps a user has done in a month.</p>
