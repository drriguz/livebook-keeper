<p>Since the public API service depends on the activity and user profile services, we either need to mock them with <em class="calibre10">fake</em> services that we run during the tests execution, or deploy them along with all their dependencies like databases. Either approach is fine, and in the next chapters we will sometimes create a fake service for running our integration tests, and sometimes we will just deploy the real services.</p>
