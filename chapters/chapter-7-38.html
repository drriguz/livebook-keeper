<p>Each service fulfills a single functional purpose, and could well be used by another application. There are 4 public services: 2 user-facing web applications, 1 service for receiving podometer device updates, and 1 service to expose a public HTTP API. Incidentally the public API is used by the user web application, and we could similarly have mobile applications connecting to it. There are 4 internal services: 1 to manage user profiles, 1 to manage activity data, 1 to congratulate users over email, and 1 to compute various stats over continuous events.</p>
