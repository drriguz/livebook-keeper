<p>You may sometimes read about <em class="calibre10">&quot;hot&quot;</em> and <em class="calibre10">&quot;cold&quot;</em> sources. A hot source is a source where events are being emitted no matter if there are subscribers or not. A cold source is a source where events only start being emitted after the first subscription. A periodic timer is a hot source, while a file to read is a cold source. With a cold source you can get all events, while with a hot source you will only get those emitted after you have subscribed.</p>
