<p>The <code class="code">start</code> method of the <code class="code">Jukebox</code> verticle (listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-4/v-10/start-eb-setup" shape="rect" title="Example 4.6. Setting up the event bus handlers">4.6</a>) needs to configure a few event-bus handlers that correspond to the command / actions that can be used from the TCP text protocol. Another verticle <code class="code">NetControl</code> that we will dissect later deals with the inners of the TCP server, and sends messages to the event bus.</p>
