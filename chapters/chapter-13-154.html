<p>When Kubernetes starts a pod, it assumes that it can serve requests on the exposed ports, and that the application is running fine as long as the process is running. If a process crashes, then Kubernetes will restart its pod. Also if a process consumes too much memory, Kubernetes will kill it and restart its pod.</p>
