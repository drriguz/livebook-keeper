<p>This pattern is illustrated in figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-3/v-10/eb-reqresp" shape="rect" title="Figure 3.2. Request-reply messaging over the event-bus">3.2</a>. A reply destination is generated by the event-bus and attached to the message before it reaches a consumer when a message expects a reply. You can inspect the reply destination name through the event-bus message API if you want, but you will rarely need to know what the destination is since you will simply call a <code class="code">reply</code> method on the message object. Of course a message consumer needs to be programmed to provide a reply when this pattern is being used.</p>
