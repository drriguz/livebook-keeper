<p>Depending on the type of cross-origin HTTP request there are <em class="calibre10">simple</em> and <em class="calibre10">pre-flighted</em> requests that web browsers do. The request in figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-8/v-10/cors-simple" shape="rect" title="Figure 8.4. Example CORS interaction">8.4</a> is a simple one. By contrast a PUT request would need a pre-flighted request as it can potentially have side effects (PUT implies modifying a resource), so a pre-flight OPTIONS HTTP request to the resource is made to check what the CORS policy is, then followed by the actual PUT request when allowed. Pre-flighted requests provide more details such as the allowed HTTP headers and methods, as a server can for example have a CORS policy of forbidding doing DELETE requests or having a <code class="code">ABC</code> header in the HTTP request. I recommend reading <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-8/v-10/MozillaCORS" shape="rect">[MozillaCORS]</a> as it provides a detailed and approachable explanation on the interactions between browsers and servers with CORS.</p>
