<p>The service immediately starts with a few errors then the circuit breaker opens, at which point the service consistently provides errors with a very low latency. Remember that the service hasnâ€™t cached any data yet. When the database starts we can see a latency spike as errors turn into successes, then the service is able to respond nominally. Note that in the first success seconds the JVM will start optimizing the code that talks to the database, hence an improving throughput.
