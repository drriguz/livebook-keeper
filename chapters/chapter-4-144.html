<p>For every HTTP response stream to a player, the method copies the read data. Note that we have another case of back-pressure management here: when the write queue of a client is full, then we simply discard data. On the player end this will result in a audio drops, but since the queue is full on the server it means that the player is going to have delays or drops anyway. Discarding data is fine as MP3 decoders know how to recover, and it ensures that playback will remain closely on time with the other players.</p>
