<p>Introduced in Vert.x 3.6, the <em class="calibre10">fetch</em> mode that we mentioned earlier in this chapter allows a stream consumer to request an amount of data items, rather than the stream pushing data items to the consumer. This works by pausing the stream, then asking varying number of items to be fetched later on as data is needed.</p>
