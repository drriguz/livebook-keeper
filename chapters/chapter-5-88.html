<p>The Vert.x <code class="code">Future</code> interface is not a subtype of <code class="code">CompletionStage</code>. The Vert.x team had thought about it while preparing the roadmap for Vert.x 4, but we ultimately opted for our own interface definition since <code class="code">CompletionStage</code> is more agnostic of the threading model. Indeed the &quot;async&quot;-suffixed methods provide variants where you can pass an executor like <code class="code">CompletionStage&lt;Void&gt; thenRunAsync(Runnable,Executor)</code>, while the variants without an executor parameter dispatch by default to a <code class="code">ForkJoinPool</code> instance. These methods allow to step out of Vert.x event-loops or worker thread pools too easily, hence we chose to offer inter-operability and not use <code class="code">CompletionStage</code> directly in the Vert.x APIs.</p>
