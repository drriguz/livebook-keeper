<p>The application code is co-located in the same module as the Vert.x application that serves the user web application, so you will find the usual Java source files under <code class="code">src/main/java</code> and a Gradle <code class="code">build.gradle.kts</code> file. The Vue.js compiled assets (<code class="code">yarn build</code>) must be copied to <code class="code">src/main/resources/webroot/assets</code> for the Vert.x-based service to serve them.</p>
