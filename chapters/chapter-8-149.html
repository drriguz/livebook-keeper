<p>The file for this component is <code class="code">src/views/Login.vue</code>. The component shows the login form, and when submitted must call the public API to get a JWT token. On success, it must store the JWT token locally, then switch the view to the <code class="code">home</code> component. On error, it must stay on the login form and display an error message.</p>
