<p>Here we convert the string result to upper-case, then prefix it with a string, and eventually <code class="code">whenComplete</code> is being called. Note that this is a <code class="code">BiConsumer</code> and you need to test which of the value or exception parameter is <code class="code">null</code> to know wether the promise did complete successfully or not. It is also important to note that unless you call an &quot;async&quot; <code class="code">CompletionStage</code> method then the calls are performed on a Vert.x thread.</p>
