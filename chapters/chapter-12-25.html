<p>The results that I present in this chapter are based on experiments conducted with 2 Apple MacBook laptops which hardly qualify as production-grade servers. I am also using a domestic WiFi network, which is not as good as an Ethernet wired connection, especially when it comes to having a stable latency. Finally macOS has very low limits on the number of file descriptors that a process can open (256), so I have to raise them with the <code class="code">ulimit</code> command to run the services and the load testing tools, otherwise errors unrelated to the services code can happen just because too many connections have been opened. I will show you how to do that, and you will likely have to use it as well for running the experiments.</p>
