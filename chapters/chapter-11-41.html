<p>The <code class="code">buffer</code> operator is one of the several aggregation operators that you can use in RxJava. It aggregates events for a time period, then passes the result as a <code class="code">List</code>. You can see that we pass a Vert.x scheduler from the <code class="code">RxHelper</code> class: this because <code class="code">buffer</code> delays event processing and by default will call the next operators on a RxJava-specific thread. The Vert.x scheduler ensures that operators are instead called from the original Vert.x context so as to preserve the Vert.x threading model.</p>
