<p>The <code class="code">StaticHandler</code> caches files in memory, unless configured otherwise in the call to the <code class="code">create</code> method. Disabling caching is useful while in development mode, because you can modify static assets content and see changes by reloading in a web browser without having to restart the Vert.x server. By default static files are resolved from the <code class="code">webroot</code> folder in the classpath, but you can override it as we did by specifying <code class="code">webroot/assets</code>.</p>
