<p>A circuit breaker is a very useful tool for avoiding cascading failures, but you donâ€™t have to wrap every operation over the network in a circuit breaker. Every abstraction has a cost, and circuit breakers do add a level of indirection. Instead it is best to use chaos testing and identify where they are most likely to have a positive effect on the overall system behavior.</p>
