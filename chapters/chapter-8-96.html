<p>The <code class="code">JWTOptions</code> class offers methods for the common claims from the JWT RFC <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-7/v-10/JWT" shape="rect">[JWT]</a> such as the issuer, expiration date and subject. We can see that we did not specify when the token was issued, although there is a method for that in <code class="code">JWTOptions</code>. The <code class="code">jwtAuth</code> object does the <em class="calibre10">right thing</em> here and adds it on our behalf.</p>
