<p>Test Containers gives lots of choices for starting one or many containers. It supports generic Docker images, specialized classes for common infrastructure (e.g., PostgreSQL, Apache Kafka, etc) and Docker Compose. Here we re-use the Docker Compose descriptor for running the whole application (<code class="code">docker-compose.yml</code>), and the containers described in the file are started before the first test is run. The containers are destroyed when all tests have executed. This is very interesting as we get to write integration tests against the real infrastructure services that would be used in production.</p>
