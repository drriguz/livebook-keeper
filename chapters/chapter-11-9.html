<p>In previous chapters we have used RxJava operators to process events of all kinds: HTTP requests, AMQP messages and Kakfa records.

Kafka provides a solid middleware for event streaming, while Vert.x provides a rich ecosystem of reactive clients to connect to other services, databases or messaging systems.</p>
