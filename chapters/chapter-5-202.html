<p>There exists a verticle base class called <code class="code">io.vertx.kotlin.coroutines.CoroutineVerticle</code> where the <code class="code">start</code> and <code class="code">stop</code> methods are suspending, so you can use coroutines directly from them. By using <code class="code">CoroutineVerticle</code> you also get to execute coroutines on the verticle event loop thread rather than on threads of a worker pool like the default Kotlin coroutines do.</p>
