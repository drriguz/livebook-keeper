<p>A coroutine can have its execution suspended and resumed at a later point in time. It can be seen as a function with multiple entry and exit points, and for which its execution stack can be resumed. Coroutines fit well with an asynchronous model, as they can be suspended when the result of an asynchronous operation is needed, and resumed when it is available.</p>
