<p>Checkpoints are flagged to mark that the test execution reached certain lines. When all declared checkpoints have been flagged, the test completes successfully. The test fails when an assertion fails, when an unexpected exception is being thrown, or when a (configurable) delay elapses and not all checkpoints have been flagged.</p>
