<p>MP3 decoders are very resilient to errors, so if they start decoding right in the middle of a file they will still manage to figure out what is the bit rate, and they will align with the next frame to start decoding audio. You can even concatenate multiple MP3 files and send them to a player, audio will be decoded as long as all files are using the same bit rate and stereo mode.</p>
