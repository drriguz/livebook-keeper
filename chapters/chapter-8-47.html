<p>JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is an open specification for securely transmitting JSON-encoded data between parties <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-7/v-10/JWT" shape="rect">[JWT]</a>. JWT tokens are signed with either a symmetric shared secret, or an asymmetric public / private key pair, so it is always possible to verify that the information that they contain has not been modified. This is very interesting as a JWT token can be used to hold claims such as identity and authorization grants. JWT tokens can be exchanged as part of HTTP requests using the <code class="code">Authorization</code> HTTP header.</p>
