<p>The Logback configuration that we are using shows the name of the thread associated with an event. We can already check an important property of Vert.x verticles in log entries: event processing happens on a single event-loop thread. Both the periodic tasks and HTTP requests processing happen on a thread that appears as <code class="code">vert.x-eventloop-thread-0</code> in the logs.</p>
