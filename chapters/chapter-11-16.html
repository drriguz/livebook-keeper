<p>Whenever a device update is processed by the activity service, it stores the update to a PostgreSQL database, then produces a Kafka record with the number of steps on the current day for the corresponding device. For instance when device <code class="code">abc</code> receives an update of say, 300 steps recorded at 11:25, then it sends a Kafka record to <code class="code">daily.step.updates</code> with the number of steps for the day corresponding to device <code class="code">abc</code>.</p>
