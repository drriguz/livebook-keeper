<p>The service is a form of <em class="calibre10">edge service</em> or <em class="calibre10">API gateway</em> as it forwards and composes requests to other services. Since this is a public HTTP API, the service requires authentication for most of its operations. To do that we use <em class="calibre10">JSON Web Token</em> <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-7/v-10/JWT" shape="rect">[JWT]</a> which we will describe in another chapter along with the service implementation. Since we want the public API to be usable from any HTTP client including JavaScript code running in a web browser, we need to support <em class="calibre10">cross-origin resource sharing</em> <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-7/v-10/CORS" shape="rect">[CORS]</a>. Again we will dig into the details in due time.</p>
