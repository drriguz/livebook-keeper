<p>By specifying a <code class="code">origin</code> HTTP header, the CORS handler inserts a <code class="code">access-control-allow-origin</code> HTTP header in the response. The HTTP status code is 405 since the OPTION HTTP method is not supported by the specific route, but this is not an issue as web browsers are only interested in the CORS-related headers when they do a pre-flight request.</p>
