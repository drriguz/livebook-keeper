<p>In a message broker, messages disappear when they have been consumed from a queue, or when they expire. Kafka partitions eventually evict records, either using a partition size limit (e.g., 2 gigabytes), or using some eviction delay (e.g., 2 weeks). Kafka records should be considered as &quot;semi-durable&quot; as they will eventually disappear. It is possible to configure the partitions in a topic to keep events <em class="calibre10">forever</em>, but this is quite rare as events are expected to produce <em class="calibre10">durable</em> effects when consumed. For instance the ingestion service produces incoming step updates records, and the activity service turns these records into long-term facts in a database. Another interesting feature of Kakfa is that topics can be replayed at will, so new services can join and consume a stream at their own pace.</p>
