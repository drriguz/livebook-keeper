<p>Listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-2/v-10/worker" shape="rect" title="Example 2.14. Sample worker verticle">2.14</a> gives an example where a worker verticle is being deployed with 2 instances. Every 10s, the code blocks for 8 seconds. Running this sample gives an output similar to that of listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-2/v-10/worker-logs" shape="rect" title="Example 2.15. Sample output of running listing 2.14">2.15</a>. As we can see, different worker threads are being used for successive events.</p>
