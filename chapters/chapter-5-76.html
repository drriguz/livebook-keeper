<p>You can think of <code class="code">flatMap</code> as <em class="calibre10">&quot;and then&quot;</em>: here the operation takes the string value and prepends it with <code class="code">&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;</code> after 3 seconds. We also see the typical promise / future pattern where we first create a promise, do an asynchronous operation that eventually completes the promise, and return a future so the value can be consumed by another piece of code.</p>
