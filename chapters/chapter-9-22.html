<p>Vert.x provides support for Apache Kafka, a popular event-streaming middleware. At first, event-streaming middlewares share some resemblance with messaging systems, but they allow for interesting architectural patterns as different services can consume the same set of events at their own pace. Of course message brokers support publish / subscribe mechanisms for multiple services to consume the same events, but event-streaming middlewares also have the ability to replay events at will. Rewinding event streams is a distinctive feature. It also allows new services to be plugged in the processing pipeline without impacting other services. You can use event-streaming middleware like a messaging middleware, but there is really more to it than just passing events between services.</p>
