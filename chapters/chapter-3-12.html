<p>An interesting property of the event-bus is that it can be extended outside of the application process. We will see in this chapter that the event-bus also works across distributed members of a cluster. Later in this book we will see how to extend the event-bus to embedded or external message brokers, to remote clients and also to JavaScript applications running in a web browser.</p>
