<p>This example opens a classic HTTP server that replies <code class="code">Ok</code> to any request. The interesting part is that the RxJava variant of <code class="code">AbstractVerticle</code> has a <code class="code">rxStart</code> (and <code class="code">rxStop</code>) method that notifies of deployment success. In our case the verticle has been successfully deployed when the HTTP server has starter, so we return a <code class="code">Completable</code> object. We can check that methods prefixed with <code class="code">rx</code> correspond to generated methods for supporting RxJava. If you inspect the RxJava APIs, you will note that the original methods (including callbacks) are still present.</p>
