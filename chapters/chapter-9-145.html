<p>The preparation consists in deploying the <code class="code">IngesterVerticle</code> verticle, and then deleting any existing <code class="code">incoming.steps</code> topic. This is useful to ensure that tests do not pollute each other with remaining Kafka events. Note the <code class="code">onErrorComplete</code> combinator: it ensures progress because deleting topics raises an error when they donâ€™t exist. We want to run the tests when <code class="code">incoming.steps</code> does not exist, which is typically the case of the first test being run. Of course <code class="code">onErrorComplete</code> can mask a deployment failure of <code class="code">IngesterVerticle</code>, but we will find out in test executions anyway.</p>
