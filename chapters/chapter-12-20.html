<p>There is a good chance that you will perform these experiments on your laptop or desktop. Keep in mind that a real server is different from your workstation on both hardware and software configurations, so you will likely perform tests with lower workloads than what the services could actually cope with in a production setting. For instance when we use PostgreSQL directly from a container, we haven’t done any tuning like we would do in a production setting. More generally running the middleware services from containers is convenient for development purposes, but we would run them differently in production, with or without containers. Also note that we will be running the Vert.x-based services without any JVM tuning. In a production setting you’d need to at least adjust memory settings and tune the garbage collector.</p>
