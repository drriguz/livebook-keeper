<p>Note that the request paths shall be prefixed with <code class="code">/api/v1</code>, so requesting a token a is a <code class="code">POST</code> request to <code class="code">/api/v1/token</code>. It is always a good idea to have some versioning scheme in the URLs of a public API. The JWT tokens are restricted to the username that was used for obtaining it, hence user <code class="code">B</code> cannot perform, say, a request to <code class="code">/api/v1/A/2019/07/14</code>.</p>
