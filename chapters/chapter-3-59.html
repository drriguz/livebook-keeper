<p>The event-bus is accessed through the <code class="code">Vertx</code> context and the <code class="code">eventBus()</code> method. Since this verticle does not know what published values will be used for, it uses the <code class="code">publish</code> method to send to subscribers on the <code class="code">sensor.updates</code> destination. We also use JSON to encode data, which is idiomatic with Vert.x.</p>
