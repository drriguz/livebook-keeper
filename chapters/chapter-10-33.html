<p>MongoDB is a good fit because it is a document database, so each user can be represented as a document. We are going to use the <code class="code">vertx-mongo-client</code> module to connect to MongoDB instances, and we are also going to use the <code class="code">vertx-auth-mongo</code> module for doing authentication.</p>
