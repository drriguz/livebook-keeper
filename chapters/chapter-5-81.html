<p>The <code class="code">listen</code> method that we had seen in earlier examples took a callback, here it returns a <code class="code">Future&lt;HttpServer&gt;</code>. We can then chain calls to <code class="code">onFailure</code> and <code class="code">onSuccess</code> to define what to do when the server starts, or when an error occurs.</p>
