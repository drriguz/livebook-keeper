<p>There are 2 types of arrows in figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-7/v-10/big-picture" shape="rect" title="Figure 7.5. Overview of the application architecture">7.5</a>. Event flows show important event exchanges between services For instance the ingestion service sends events to <em class="calibre10">Kafka</em>, while the event stats service both consumes and produces <em class="calibre10">Kafka</em> events. We also denoted dependencies: as an example the public API service depends on the user profile and activities services, which in turn depend on their own databases for data persistence.</p>
