<p>Figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-3/v-10/clustered-app-run" shape="rect" title="Figure 3.8. Screenshot of the application running in clustered mode">3.8</a> shows the application running with 1 browser connected to the instance with port 8080, another browser connected to the second instance with port 8081, and we see logs from the <code class="code">Listener</code> verticle in the background. As we can see, both instances display events from the 8 sensors, and the first instance has its average temperature updated so it can interact with the <code class="code">SensorData</code> verticle on the second instance.</p>
