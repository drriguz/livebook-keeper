<p>Compared to the other implementations there is not much difference except that the <code class="code">start</code> method is suspending, and starting the HTTP server is done using <code class="code">listenAwait</code>. Since that method call is suspending, the execution resumes when the HTTP server is running, and the method returns the HTTP server instance, which we simply ignore here.</p>
