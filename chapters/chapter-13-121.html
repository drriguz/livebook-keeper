<p>We start a clustered Vert.x context and pass options to customize the event-bus configuration. In most cases you donâ€™t need to do any extra tuning here, but in the context of Kubernetes clustering will likely resolve to <code class="code">localhost</code> rather the actual host IPv4 address. This is why we first resolve the IPv4 address, then set the event-bus configuration host to that address, so the other nodes can talk to it.</p>
