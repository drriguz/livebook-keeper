<p>The event stats service consumes these events to enrich them with user data, so other services can be updated in real-time about the number of steps recorded on the current day for any user. To do that we take the records from the <code class="code">daily.step.updates</code> Kafka topic, and add the data from the user API: user name, email, city, and whether data shall be public. The enriched data is then sent as records to the <code class="code">event-stats.user-activity.updates</code> topic.</p>
