<p>The test simulates two sensors with identifiers <code class="code">abc</code> and <code class="code">def</code> by sending <em class="calibre10">fake</em> sensor data updates over the event-bus, just like a sensor would do. We then have determinism in our assertions, and we can check the behavior for both <code class="code">valueFor</code> and <code class="code">average</code> methods.</p>
