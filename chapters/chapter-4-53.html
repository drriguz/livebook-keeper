<p>Table <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-4/v-10/writestream-backpressure" shape="rect" title="Table 4.5. WriteStream back-pressure management methods.">4.5</a> shows the corresponding back-pressure management methods for <code class="code">WriteStream</code>. The write buffer queue has a maximum size after which it is considered to be full. Write queues have default sizes that you will rarely want to tweak, but you can do so if you want to. Note that writes can still be made and data will <em class="calibre10">just</em> accumulate in the queue. A writer is supposed to check when the queue is full, but there is no enforcement on writes.</p>
