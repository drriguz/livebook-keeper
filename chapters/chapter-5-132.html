<p>Using the <code class="code">just</code> factory method is great in examples and tests, but of course in real-world scenarios you will want to adapt a more complex source to produce events to an RxJava observable type. To do that, there is a general-purpose <code class="code">Publisher</code> interface that you can implement to emit items to subscribers using the <code class="code">fromPublisher</code> method (instead of <code class="code">just</code>). There are also adapter methods for JDK futures, iterable objects and also generating items from a JDK callable object.</p>
