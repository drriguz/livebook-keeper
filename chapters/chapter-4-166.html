<p>What we actually want is reasoning about <em class="calibre10">lines</em>, hence the solution is to concatenate buffers as they arrive, and look for new lines in them to split buffers. Instead of manually assembling intermediary buffers, Vert.x offers a handy parsing helper with the <code class="code">RecordParser</code> class. The parser ingests buffers and emits new buffers with parsed data, either by looking for delimiters, or by working with chunks of fixed size.</p>
