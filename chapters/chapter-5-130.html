<p>The observable of string values will just emit one error. The <code class="code">map</code> operator will never be called, since it operates only on values, not errors. We can see that <code class="code">subscribe</code> now has 2 parameter: the second one is the callback to process errors. In this case we just print the stack trace but in, say, networked applications we would do error recovery.</p>
