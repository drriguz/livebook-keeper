<p>With HTTP probes Kubernetes is interested in the HTTP status code of the response: 200 means the check succeeded, and anything else means that there is a problem. It is a loose convention to return a JSON document with a <code class="code">status</code> field and values <code class="code">UP</code> or <code class="code">DOWN</code>. Additional data can be in the document, for example messages from various checks being done. This data is mostly useful when logged for diagnosis purposes.</p>
