<p>Vert.x futures are also inter-operable with the <code class="code">CompletionStage</code> interface of the <code class="code">java.util.concurrent</code> package in the JDK. The <code class="code">CompletionStage</code> interface represents a step in an asynchronous operation, so you can think of it as being a future, especially as there is a class called <code class="code">CompletableFuture</code> that implements <code class="code">CompletionStage</code>. For instance the HTTP client API in Java 11 offers <code class="code">sendAsync</code> methods that return <code class="code">CompletableFuture</code> to make asynchronous HTTP requests.</p>
