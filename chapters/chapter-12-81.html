<p>The 99.99th percentile latency is very good while the throughput is high. We get better results with Hey compared to a 100 users workload with Locust. We can see a few short throughput drops correlated with higher latency responses, but there is nothing to worry about in these conditions. These drops could have been caused by various factors, including PostgreSQL, the WiFi network or a JVM garbage collector run. It is easy to get better results with better hardware running Linux, a wired network, some JVM tuning and a properly configured PostgreSQL database server.</p>
