<p>So we have a public API that forwards requests to internal services, and this API uses JWT tokens for authentication and access control. We also demonstrated on the command-line that we can interact with the API. In fact <em class="calibre10">any</em> third-party application can talk to our API over HTTP: a mobile phone application, another service, a desktop application, etc. You could think that web applications can also talk to the API from JavaScript code running in web browsers, but it is (fortunately!) not that simple.</p>
