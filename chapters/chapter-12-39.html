<p>As described in chapter 7, you need to run the container services with Docker Compose from the <code class="code">part2-steps-challenge</code> folder using <code class="code">docker-compose up</code> in a terminal, then run all Vert.x-based services in another terminal. You can use <code class="code">foreman start</code> if you have <code class="code">foreman</code> installed, or else you can run all services using the commands in <code class="code">Procfile</code>.</p>
