<p>Listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-2/v-10/async-lifecycle" shape="rect" title="Example 2.7. Example of an asynchronous start life-cycle method">2.7</a> provides an example where the verticle reports an asynchronous notification when it starts. It is important because starting a HTTP server <em class="calibre10">can</em> fail. Indeed, the TCP port may be used by another process, in which case the HTTP server cannot start, and hence the verticle has not successfully deployed. To do that, we use a variant of the <code class="code">listen</code> method with callback called when the operation completes.</p>
