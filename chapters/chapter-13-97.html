<p>Project dependencies are put just above the base image: they are typically bigger than the application code and resources, and they also tend not to change very often except when upgrading versions and adding new dependencies. When a project has snapshot dependencies then they appear as a layer on top of the fixed-version dependencies, because newer snapshots appear frequently. The resources then class files change more often and they are typically light on disk usage, so they end up on top. This clever layering approach does not just save disk space: it also improves build time since layers can often be reused.</p>
