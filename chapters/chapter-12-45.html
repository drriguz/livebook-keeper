<p>Letâ€™s take the example of the latency at the 80th percentile: this is the maximum latency observed for 80% of the requests. If that latency is of 100ms, then it means that 80% of the requests took less than 100ms. Similarly, if the 95th percentile latency is of 150ms, then it means that 95% of the requests took at most 150ms. The 100th percentile reveals the worst case observed.</p>
