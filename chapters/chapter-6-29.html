<p>Vert.x does not rely on magic through bytecode engineering or reflection at runtime, so service proxies and handlers need to be written and compiled. Fortunately Vert.x comes with code generators, so you will generate both the service proxies and handlers at compilation time rather than write them yourself.</p>
