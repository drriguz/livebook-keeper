<p>The circuit breaker leaves the <em class="calibre10">open</em> state to the <em class="calibre10">half-open</em> state after some <em class="calibre10">reset</em> timeout. The first request in the <em class="calibre10">half-open</em> state is used to know if the service has recovered. Unlike the <em class="calibre10">open</em> state, the <em class="calibre10">half-open</em> state is where we start doing a real operation again. If it succeeds then the circuit breaker goes back to the <em class="calibre10">closed</em> state and resumes normal servicing. If not then another reset period starts before going back to the <em class="calibre10">half-open</em> state and check if the service is back.</p>
