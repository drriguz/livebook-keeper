<p>While the ingestion service <em class="calibre10">produces</em> Kafka events, the congratulation service <em class="calibre10">consumes</em> Kafka events. The activity service generate daily step events whenever a device update has been received. Each event contains the number of steps recorded for the originating device on the current day. The congratulation service can observe these events as they are sent to the <code class="code">daily.step.updates</code> Kafka topic, and target the events where the number of steps is above 10000.</p>
