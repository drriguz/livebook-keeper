<p>So far we have seen examples with <code class="code">start()</code> life-cycle methods. The contract in these methods is that a verticle has successfully completed its <code class="code">start</code> life-cycle event processing unless the method throws an exception. The same applies for <code class="code">stop()</code> methods.</p>
