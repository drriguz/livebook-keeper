<p>Speaking of &quot;traditional&quot; relational databases, Vert.x can connect to <em class="calibre10">anything</em> for which there exists a JDBC driver. That being said JDBC is an older protocol based on a multi-threaded design and blocking I/O. The JDBC support in Vert.x offloads database calls to worker thread pools, and pushes results back to event-loop contexts. This is to avoid blocking event-loops since JDBC calls do block. Of course this design limits scalability as worker threads are needed, but for moderate workloads this should be fine.</p>
