<p>Vert.x applications can run in clustering mode where a set of Vert.x application nodes can work together over the network. They may be node instances of the same application and have the same set of deployed verticles, but this is not a requirement. Some nodes can have a set of verticles A, while others have a set of verticles B.</p>
