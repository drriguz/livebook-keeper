<p>Vert.x uses Netty and logging in Netty is quite verbose with the default Logback configuration. We can reduce the amount of log entries by creating a <code class="code">src/main/resources/logback.xml</code> file and adding the configuration as in listing <a class="pcalibre para2" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-2/v-10/logback-config" shape="rect" title="Example 2.2. Logback configuration to reduce Netty verbosity">2.2</a>. To make the log samples shorter in this book we also removed event dates and shortened logger class names (<code class="code">$logger{0}</code>). Please refer to the Logback documentation to understand how to configure it <a class="pcalibre para2" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-2/v-10/LogbackDoc" shape="rect">[LogbackDoc]</a>.</p>
