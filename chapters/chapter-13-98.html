<p>Jib offers Maven and Gradle plugins, and it builds container images by deriving information from a project. Jib is also great because it is purely written in Java and it does not need Docker to build images, so you can produce container images without any third-party tool. It can also publish container images to registries and Docker daemons, which is useful in development.</p>
