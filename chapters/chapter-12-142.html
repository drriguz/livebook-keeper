<p>Compared to the experiment in figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-12/v-10/plot-hey-run-steps-chaos-baseline-z5m" shape="rect" title="Figure 12.6. Total steps count load test with failures">12.6</a> we still have drastically reduced throughputs during failures, but at least we see errors being reported thanks to the timeout enforcements. We also see that the maximum latency is below 6 seconds, which is in line with 5 seconds timeouts.</p>
