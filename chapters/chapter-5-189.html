<p>The call to <code class="code">delay</code> does not block the caller thread because that method can be suspended. The method is being called again when the time has elapsed, and resumes executing at the next line, which returns a string. In a callback world the <code class="code">delay</code> function would have taken a callback parameter, which would have had to pass the returned string to the caller, probably using another callback.</p>
