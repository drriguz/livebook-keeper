<p>You may have heard of <em class="calibre9">&quot;command query responsibility segregation (CQRS)&quot;</em> <a class="pcalibre para2" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-7/v-10/CQRS" shape="rect">[CQRS]</a> and <em class="calibre9">&quot;event-sourcing&quot;</em> <a class="pcalibre para2" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-7/v-10/EventSourcing" shape="rect">[EventSourcing]</a> which are patterns found in event-driven architectures. CQRS structures how to read and write information, while event sourcing is about having the application state materialized as a sequence of facts. The proposed application architecture relates to both notions, but since it is not strictly faithful to the definitions I prefer to just call it an <em class="calibre9">&quot;event-driven micro-services architecture&quot;</em>.</p>
