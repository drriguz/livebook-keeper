<p>The <code class="code">kubectl port-forward</code> command must be run in another terminal, and as long as it is running then the local port 8080 forwards to the sensor gateway service inside the cluster. This is very convenient to access anything that is running in the cluster without being exposed as a <code class="code">LoadBalancer</code> service.</p>
