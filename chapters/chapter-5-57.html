<p>Nested callbacks surely do not render the code more readable, yet I argue that the real issue lies in the fact that the functional code is entangled with asynchronous coordination code. You need to decipher from the loop, callbacks and branching that 3 HTTP requests are being made in parallel, that their results are being assembled, sent to a third-party service and then given back as a response.</p>
