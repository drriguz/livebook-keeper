<p>We are going to open the circuit breaker after 5 failures, including operations timing out after 5 seconds (to be consistent with the previous experiments). The reset timeout is set to 10 seconds, which lets us frequently check how the service goes. How long shall this value be is up to your context, but you can anticipate that long timeouts increase the time a service operates in degraded mode or reports errors, while short values may diminish the effectiveness of using a circuit breaker.</p>
