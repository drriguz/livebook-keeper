<p>As such, testing verticles is more <em class="calibre10">integration testing</em> than <em class="calibre10">unit testing</em>, independently of whether verticles under test are being deployed within the same JVM or in cluster mode. We need to see verticles as black boxes we communicate with via the event-bus, and possibly via connecting to network protocols that verticles expose. For instance when a verticle exposes a HTTP service, we are likely going to issue HTTP requests in tests to check its behavior.</p>
