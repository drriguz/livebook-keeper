<p>The key properties of reactive application is that they remain <em class="calibre10">responsive</em> under demanding workloads and when they face failure of other services. By responsive we mean that latency for service response remains under control. A good responsiveness example would be a service that responds within 500ms in the 99% percentile, provided that 500ms is a good number given the service functional requirements and operational constraints.</p>
