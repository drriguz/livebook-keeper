<p>While this is true, the callback-hell can be easily mitigated using 1 method for each asynchronous operation callback as we did with methods <code class="code">handleRequest</code>, <code class="code">sendToSnapshot</code> and <code class="code">sendResponse</code>. Each method does exactly one thing and we avoid nesting of callbacks.</p>
