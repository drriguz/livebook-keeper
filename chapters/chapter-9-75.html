<p>To delay the re-subscription by 10 seconds, we use the <code class="code">delay</code> operator. It will eventually emit a value hence <code class="code">onNext</code> will be called and a re-subscription happens. You can of course think of more elaborated handlers, like limiting the number of retries and/or using an exponential back-off strategy. We will use this pattern a lot, as it greatly simplifies the error recovery logic.</p>
