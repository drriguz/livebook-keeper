<p>Future and promises are a simple and effective model to compose asynchronous operations. They are built-in into the Vert.x core APIs starting from version 4, and they offer the essential tools to deal with asynchronous results: transforming values (<code class="code">map</code>), recovering from errors (<code class="code">recover</code> / <code class="code">otherwise</code>), chaining (<code class="code">flatMap</code>) and composition (<code class="code">CompositeFuture</code>). They also provide inter-operability with <code class="code">CompletionStage</code> from the JDK.</p>
