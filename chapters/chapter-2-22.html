<p>Defining a verticle code in Java is typically done by specializing the <code class="code">AbstractVerticle</code> class. There exists a <code class="code">Verticle</code> interface that one could in theory implement, but <code class="code">AbstractVerticle</code> provides all the event processing, configuration and execution plumbing that Vert.x users need.</p>
