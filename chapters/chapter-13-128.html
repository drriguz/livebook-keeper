<p>This deployment descriptor deploys by default 4 pods of the <code class="code">vertx-in-action/heat-sensor-service</code> container image. Deploying pods is a good first step, but we also need a <em class="calibre10">service</em> definition that maps to these pods. This is especially important for Hazelcast: remember that instances discover themselves through Kubernetes services with label <code class="code">vertx-in-action</code> and value <code class="code">chapter13</code>.</p>
