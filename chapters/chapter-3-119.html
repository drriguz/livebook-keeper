<p>There is no good answer to the question of what cluster manager you should be using. It very much depends on whether you need special integration with one library, and also in what type of environment you need to deploy. If say, you need to use the <em class="calibre9">Infinispan</em> APIs in your code and not just <em class="calibre9">Infinispan</em> as the cluster manager engine for Vert.x, then you should go with <em class="calibre9">Infinispan</em> to cover both needs.</p>
