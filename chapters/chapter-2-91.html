<p>Interestingly, we are deploying 50 verticles from <code class="code">Deployer</code>, yet there are likely less threads than verticles that appear in logs. By default Vert.x creates twice the number of event-loop threads than CPU cores. If you have 8 cores then a Vert.x application has 16 event-loops. The assignment of verticles to event-loops is done in a round-robin fashion.</p>
