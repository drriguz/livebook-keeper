<p>It is a good robustness practice to use the asynchronous method variants that accept a callback to notify of errors, just like the <code class="code">listen</code> method in listing <a class="pcalibre para2" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-2/v-10/async-lifecycle" shape="rect" title="Example 2.7. Example of an asynchronous start life-cycle method">2.7</a>. We will not always do this in the remainder of this book when it allows us to reduce the verbosity of code samples.</p>
