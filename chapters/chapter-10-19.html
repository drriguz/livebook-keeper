<p>The code of the 10k steps challenge may surprise you because it does not perform object data mapping, where any data has to be mapped to some Java object model that represent the application domain (e.g., <em class="calibre10">data transfer objects</em> <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-10/v-10/DTO" shape="rect">[DTO]</a>). For instance some JSON data representing a pedometer update would be mapped to some <code class="code">DeviceUpdate</code> Java class before any further processing is being made. Here we will directly manipulate data in <code class="code">JsonObject</code> instances as they flow between HTTP, Kafka and database interfaces. We will not map, say, device update JSON data to <code class="code">DeviceUpdate</code> and we will &quot;simply&quot; work with the <code class="code">JsonObject</code> representation of that data instead.</p>
