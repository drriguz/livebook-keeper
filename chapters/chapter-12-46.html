<p>When measuring performance we are often interested in the latencies between the 95th and 100th percentiles. Suppose that latency at the 90th percentile is 50ms, but 3s at the 95th percentile and 20s at the 99th percentile. In such a case we clearly have a performance problem because we observe a large share of bad latencies. By contrast observing a latency of 50ms at the 90th percentile and 70ms at the 99th percentile shows a service with a very consistent behavior.</p>
