<p>RxJava allows to reason about <em class="calibre10">streams</em> of events in a <em class="calibre10">functional</em> and <em class="calibre10">declarative</em> fashion. It is especially very powerful in terms of error management and recovery. There are operators for retrying failed operations, handling timeouts and switching the processing to another value or pipeline in case of errors. There is however an inherent risk of <em class="calibre10">&quot;monad hell&quot;</em> when building a long chain of (sometimes nested) operators, and the code becomes harder to read. Splitting processing into multiple methods is a good strategy. Operators like <code class="code">zip</code>, <code class="code">flatMap</code> or <code class="code">concatMap</code> are not necessarily meaningful if you are not much familiar with functional programming idioms. Also, not every processing is easy to express as pipelines, especially when conditional branching is involved.</p>
