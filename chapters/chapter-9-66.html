<p>This pipeline is interesting as it is purely declarative. It starts with the creation of a client, then obtains a receiver for the <code class="code">step-events</code> durable queue, then a flow of messages. From there we declare what to do upon receiving a message or an error. We also keep the code short and clean by using Java method references rather than lambdas. But what do these <code class="code">logAmqpError</code>, <code class="code">retryLater</code> and <code class="code">handleAmqpMessage</code> methods do?</p>
