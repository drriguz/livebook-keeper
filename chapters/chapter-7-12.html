<p>An increasing workload will almost always degrade latency, but in the case of a reactive application the goal is to avoid latency explosion as the service is under stress. Part 1 of this book mostly taught us asynchronous programming with Vert.x, which is the key ingredient to face growing workloads. We saw that asynchronous processing of events allowed us to multiplex thousands of open network connections on a single thread. This model (when implemented correctly!) is much more resource-friendly and scalable than the traditional &quot;1 thread per connection&quot; model.</p>
