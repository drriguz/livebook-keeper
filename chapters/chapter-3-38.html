<p>This messaging pattern works well for mimicking remote procedure calls, but with the response being sent in an asynchronous fashion so there is no need to keep waiting until it comes back. For example a HTTP API verticle can send a request to a data store verticle to fetch some data, and the data store verticle eventually gives back a reply message.</p>
