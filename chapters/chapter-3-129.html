<p>The goal is to show that by launching 1 instance of each deployment in clustering mode, verticles communicate just as if they were running within the same JVM process. Connecting with a web browser to either of the instance will give the same view to the 8 sensors data. Similarly the <code class="code">Listener</code> verticle on the second instance will get temperature updates from the first instance.</p>
