<p>In publish / subscribe communications there is even more decoupling between producers and consumers. When a message is being sent to a destination, all subscribers receive it, as illustrated per figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-3/v-10/eb-pubsub" shape="rect" title="Figure 3.3. Publish / subscribe messaging over the event-bus">3.3</a>. Messages <code class="code">M1</code>, <code class="code">M2</code> and <code class="code">M3</code> are each sent by a different producer, and all subscribers receive the messages unlike in the case of point-to-point messaging (see figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-3/v-10/eb-ptop" shape="rect" title="Figure 3.1. Point-to-point messaging over the event-bus">3.1</a>). It is not possible to specify reply handlers for publish / subscribe communications on the event-bus.</p>
