<p>As reads here are much faster than writes, a write buffer as in figure <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-4/v-10/read-then-write" shape="rect" title="Figure 4.1. Reading then writing data between streams without any back-pressure signaling">4.1</a> may quickly grow very large. Suppose that we have several thousand concurrent connections to download ISO images, then we may have lots of buffers accumulated in write buffer queues. We may actually have several gigabytes worth of ISO images in a JVM process memory, waiting to be written over the network!</p>
