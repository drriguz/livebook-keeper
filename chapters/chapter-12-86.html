<p>Here the results show again a quite consistent behavior, albeit with a higher latency and lower throughput to what the steps count endpoint could achieve. This is easy to explain as there are 2 HTTP requests to the user profile service, then the token has to be generated and signed. The HTTP requests are mostly I/O-bound, while token signing requires CPU-bound work to be done on the event-loop. The results are consistent over the 5 minutes run.</p>
