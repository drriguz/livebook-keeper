<p>We could reuse the <code class="code">buffer</code> operator as in listing <a class="calibre8 pcalibre" href="/book/vertx-in-action/chapter-11/v-10/throughput-pipeline" shape="rect" title="Example 11.5. RxJava pipeline for computing ingestion throughput">11.5</a>, and then iterate over the list of records. For each record we would update a hash table entry where the key would be the the city, and the value would be the number of steps. We would then publish an update for each city based on the values in the hash table.</p>
