<p>The <code class="code">prepare</code> method is executed before each test case does to prepare the test environment. We use it here to deploy the <code class="code">DataVerticle</code> verticle, then fetch the service proxy and store it in the <code class="code">dataService</code> field. Since deploying a verticle is an asynchronous operation, the <code class="code">prepare</code> method is being injected a <code class="code">Vertx</code> context and a <code class="code">VertxTestContext</code> object to notify when it has completed.</p>
