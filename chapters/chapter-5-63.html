<p>A <em class="calibre10">promise</em> holds the value of some computation for which there is no value <em class="calibre10">right now</em>. A promise is eventually <em class="calibre10">completed</em> with a result value or an error. In the context of asynchronous I/O, a promise is a natural fit for holding the result of an asynchronous operation. In turn a <em class="calibre10">future</em> allows to <em class="calibre10">read</em> a value which will be eventually available from a promise.</p>
