<p>This chapter is extensively based on experiments, hence we need to generate some workloads to assess how the application copes with demanding workloads and failures. There are many load testing tools around and it is not always easy to pick one. Some tools are very good at stressing a service with a specific request (e.g., <em class="calibre10">&quot;what is the latency when issuing 500 requests per second to /api/hello&quot;</em>). Some tools provide more flexibility by offering scripting capabilities (e.g., <em class="calibre10">&quot;simulate a user that logs in, then adds items to a cart, then perform a purchase&quot;</em>). And finally, some tools do all of that, but the reported metrics may be inaccurate due to how such tools are implemented.</p>
