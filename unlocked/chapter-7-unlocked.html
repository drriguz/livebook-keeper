To do that, we are going to base the next chapters on developing a fully reactive application out of several event-driven micro-services. Before that we need to specify these services.</p>

   <p>It is now time to explore the last facet: <em class="calibre10">reactive applications</em>. As a reminder from chapter 1, reactive applications are <em class="calibre10">elastic</em>, <em class="calibre10">resilient</em>, <em class="calibre10">responsive</em> and <em class="calibre10">message-driven</em> in the so-called <em class="calibre10">"Reactive Manifesto"</em>.</p>

   <p>The key properties of reactive application is that they remain responsive under demanding workloads and when they face failure of other services. By responsive we mean that latency for service response remains under control. A good responsiveness example would be a service that responds within 500ms in the 99% percentile, provided that 500ms is a good number given the service functional requirements and operational constraints.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text scrambled" refid="12" id="12" data-hash="edf5abc37a870bc05e242b0a6ccc1c09"> 
   <p>An increasing workload will almost always degrade latency, but in the case of a reactive application the goal is to avoid latency explosion as the service is under stress. Part 1 of this book mostly taught us asynchronous programming with Vert.x, which is the key ingredient to face growing workloads. We saw that asynchronous processing of events allowed us to multiplex thousands of open network connections on a single thread. This model (when implemented correctly!) is much more resource-friendly and scalable than the traditional "1 thread per connection" model.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text scrambled" refid="13" id="13" data-hash="24d2c52b6c7fceb05b54d04a4ebb40bc"> 
   <p>So Vert.x gives us a foundation for asynchronous programming on top of the JVM to meet demanding workloads, but how about dealing with failure? This is the other core challenge that we have to meet, and the answer is not that of a magic tool to pick off-the-shelf. Suppose that we have a service that talks to some database that becomes irresponsive because of some internal problem like a deadlock. Then some delay will elapse until our service gets notified of an error, for instance in the form of a TCP connection timeout. In such a case the latency explodes. By contrast if the database is down, then we get an immediate TCP connection error: latency is very good, but since the service cannot talk to its database then it is unable to process a request!</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text scrambled" refid="14" id="14" data-hash="3cd4a5ce85e734cc2da3f539d1218445"> 
   <p>We will see in the last chapter of part 2 how to experiment with "what happens when things go wrong", and discuss possible solutions to keep services responsive. You could be tempted to enforce strict timeouts on all calls to other services (including databases), or use circuit-breakers (more on that in the last chapter) everywhere but a more analytic approach will help you see what solution to use, if any, and when. It is also important to see failure in the light of a service functional requirements and application domain: the response to failure may not always be an error. For instance if we can’t get the latest temperature update from a sensor, then we may serve the last known value, and attach a timestamp to it so the requester has all the necessary context attached to the data.</p>

     <p>You may have heard of "command query responsibility segregation (CQRS)" [CQRS] and "event-sourcing" [EventSourcing] which are patterns found in event-driven architectures. CQRS structures how to read and write information, while event sourcing is about having the application state materialized as a sequence of facts. The proposed application architecture relates to both notions, but since it is not strictly faithful to the definitions I prefer to just call it an "event-driven micro-services architecture".</p>

   <p>Each service fulfills a single functional purpose, and could well be used by another application. There are 4 public services: 2 user-facing web applications, 1 service for receiving podometer device updates, and 1 service to expose a public HTTP API. Incidentally the public API is used by the user web application, and we could similarly have mobile applications connecting to it. There are 4 internal services: 1 to manage user profiles, 1 to manage activity data, 1 to congratulate users over email, and 1 to compute various stats over continuous events.</p>

   <p>All services are powered by Vert.x, and we also need some third-party middleware, labelled as "infrastructure services" in figure 7.5. We use 2 different types of databases: a document-oriented database (MongoDB) and a relational database (PostgreSQL). We need a SMTP server to send emails. Apache Kafka is being used for for event stream processing between some services. Since the ingestion service may receive updates from HTTP and AMQP, we also use an ActiveMQ Artemis server.</p>

   <p>There are 2 types of arrows in figure 7.5. Event flows show important event exchanges between services For instance the ingestion service sends events to Kafka, while the event stats service both consumes and produces Kafka events. We also denoted dependencies: as an example the public API service depends on the user profile and activities services, which in turn depend on their own databases for data persistence.</p>

   <p>It all starts with a podometer sending an update to the ingestion service, which verifies that the update contains all required data. The ingestion service then sends the update to a Kafka topic, and the podometer device is acknowledged so it knows that the update has been well-received and will be processed. The update will be handled by multiple consumers listening on that particular Kafka topic, and among them is the activity service. This service will record the data to the PostgreSQL database, then publish another record to a Kafka topic with the number of steps done by the podometer on that day. This record is being picked by the event stats service, which observes updates over windows of 5 seconds, splits by city, and aggregates the number of steps. It then posts an update with the increment in steps observed for a given city as another Kafka record. This record is then consumed by the dashboard web application, which finally sends an update to all connected web browsers that in turn update the display.</p>

     <p>As you dig through the specifications then implementation of the services, you may find the decomposition a bit artificial at times. For instance the user profile and activity services could well be just one, saving some requests to join data from the 2 services. Remember that the decomposition was also made for pedagogical reasons, and to show relevant elements from the Vert.x stack. Making an application from (micro) services requires some compromises, especially as some services may be pre-existing and you have to deal with them as they are, or you have limited abilities to evolve them.</p>

     <p>You may also find that the proposed architecture is not a nicely-layered one, with some services nicely decoupled and some other services having stronger dependencies on others. Again, this is done on purpose and for pedagogical purposes. More often than not real-world applications actually have to make compromises to deliver working software rather than pursue a quest for architecture perfection.</p>

First of all we only acknowledge the incoming device update records in Kafka after the last operation has completed.

We simply handle a duplicate insertion error as a normal case to have idem-potency, and follow along with the next steps until they have all completed.

   <p>The service is a form of edge service or API gateway as it forwards and composes requests to other services. Since this is a public HTTP API, the service requires authentication for most of its operations. To do that we use JSON Web Token [JWT] which we will describe in another chapter along with the service implementation. Since we want the public API to be usable from any HTTP client including JavaScript code running in a web browser, we need to support cross-origin resource sharing [CORS]. Again we will dig into the details in due time.</p>

   <p>Once the application services have been built, you will need to run all infrastructure services like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Apache Kafka, etc. You can greatly simplify the task by running them from Docker containers. To do that, the docker-compose.yml file describes several containers to be run with Docker Compose, a simple and effective tool to manage several containers at once. Running docker-compose up will start all containers, while docker-compose down will stop and remove them all. You can also hit Ctrl+C in a terminal running Docker Compose and it will stop the containers (but not remove them so they can be started with the current state again).</p>
